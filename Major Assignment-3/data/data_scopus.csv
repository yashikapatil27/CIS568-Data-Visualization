Virtual reality applications for the built environment: Research trends and opportunities,2020,2-s2.0-85086464158,"With its advanced capabilities of immersive and interactive visualization, virtual reality (VR) has been advocated to facilitate design, engineering, construction, and management for the built environment. Substantial efforts have thus been devoted to VR-related applications in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry over the last decades, resulting in a vast, diverse, and fragmented body of knowledge. The objective of this research is to systematically gain an in-depth understanding of research trends as well as reveal challenges and opportunities for future research in the area. To achieve this objective, this research explores the state-of-the-art in VR applications for the built environment by a mixed quantitative-qualitative review method. A total of 229 journal articles are collected using a structured data acquisition approach from Scopus and then fed into a bibliometric analysis to construct science maps. By doing so, the main research outlets, articles, and themes of this research field are quantitatively identified. Subsequently, an in-depth qualitative discussion is presented to provide deeper insights into the challenges and opportunities of main research topics. Furthermore, future research directions are proposed as follows: 1) user-centered adaptive design, 2) attention-driven virtual reality information systems, 3) construction training systems incorporating human factors, 4) occupant-centered facility management, and 5) industry adoption. This research contributes to the body of knowledge by synthesizing the state of the art of VR technology for the built environment and exposing its research needs, which can serve both academia and industry in terms of promoting VR applications for the built environment. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Elsevier B.V.,,,"Zhang Y., Liu H., Kang S.-C., Al-Hussein M.",57202536919;53984550800;57215426514;6603541102;,"Zhang, Y., Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB  T6G 1H9, Canada; Liu, H., Department of Civil and Construction Engineering, Western Michigan University, Kalamazoo, MI  49008-5316, United States; Kang, S.-C., Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB  T6G 1H9, Canada; Al-Hussein, M., Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB  T6G 1H9, Canada",Automation in Construction,Autom Constr,
"Self-tracking while doing sport: Comfort, motivation, attention and lifestyle of athletes using personal informatics tools",2020,2-s2.0-85082875828,"The spread of wearable technologies is paving the way for the mass-scale adoption of self-tracking instruments, which are progressively integrating into different social practices. Among these, sport seems to be a promising domain in which Personal Informatics tools can support individuals in performing their activities and in achieving their situated goals. In this article, we conducted semi-structured interviews with amateur and elite athletes to explore what they seek in their trackers, how such instruments may impact on their “mind”, by affecting their motivation and attention during workouts and races, and how sports data are intertwined with other information pertaining to their lifestyle. On the basis of these findings we discussed three themes that may be relevant for Personal Informatics, also proposing a series of implications for design that may help researchers in designing self-tracking tools for sport. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Academic Press,,,"Rapp A., Tirabeni L.",23398572100;57191836654;,"Rapp, A., Computer Science Department, University of Torino, C.so Svizzera, 185, Torino, 10149, Italy; Tirabeni, L., Department of Cultures, Politics and Society, University of Torino, Torino, Italy",International Journal of Human Computer Studies,Int J Hum Comput Stud,
"Bridge damage: Detection, IFC-based semantic enrichment and visualization",2020,2-s2.0-85078194587,"Building Information Modeling (BIM) representations of bridges enriched by inspection data will add tremendous value to future Bridge Management Systems (BMSs). This paper presents an approach for point cloud-based detection of spalling damage, as well as integrating damage components into a BIM via semantic enrichment of an as-built Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) model. An approach for generating the as-built BIM, geometric reconstruction of detected damage point clusters and semantic-enrichment of the corresponding IFC model is presented. Multiview-classification is used and evaluated for the detection of spalling damage features. The semantic enrichment of as-built IFC models is based on injecting classified and reconstructed damage clusters back into the as-built IFC, thus generating an accurate as-is IFC model compliant to the BMS inspection requirements. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Elsevier B.V.,,,"Isailović D., Stojanovic V., Trapp M., Richter R., Hajdin R., Döllner J.",57205293410;56421700900;24831175200;36195159400;6507346536;6602981892;,"Isailović, D., Department for Construction Project Management, Faculty of Civil Engineering, University of Belgrade, Bul. kralja Aleksandra 73, Belgrade, 11120, Serbia; Stojanovic, V., Hasso Plattner Institute, Faculty of Digital Engineering, Computer Graphics Systems Group, University of Potsdam, Prof.-Dr.-Helmert-Strasse 2-3, Potsdam, 14482, Germany; Trapp, M., Hasso Plattner Institute, Faculty of Digital Engineering, Computer Graphics Systems Group, University of Potsdam, Prof.-Dr.-Helmert-Strasse 2-3, Potsdam, 14482, Germany; Richter, R., Hasso Plattner Institute, Faculty of Digital Engineering, Computer Graphics Systems Group, University of Potsdam, Prof.-Dr.-Helmert-Strasse 2-3, Potsdam, 14482, Germany; Hajdin, R., Department for Construction Project Management, Faculty of Civil Engineering, University of Belgrade, Bul. kralja Aleksandra 73, Belgrade, 11120, Serbia; Döllner, J., Hasso Plattner Institute, Faculty of Digital Engineering, Computer Graphics Systems Group, University of Potsdam, Prof.-Dr.-Helmert-Strasse 2-3, Potsdam, 14482, Germany",Automation in Construction,Autom Constr,
VR system for spatio-temporal visualization of tweet data and support of map exploration,2019,2-s2.0-85075706132,"Social media analysis is helpful to understand the behavior of people. Human behavior in social media is related to time and location, which is often difficult to find the characteristics appropriately and quickly. We chose to apply virtual reality (VR) technologies to present the spatio-temporal social media data. This makes us easier to develop interactive and intuitive user interfaces and explore the data as we want. This paper proposes a VR system featuring two visualization techniques. One of the techniques is a three-dimensional temporal visualization of tweets of microblogs with location information. It consists of the two-dimensional map and a time axis. In particular, we aggregate the number of tweets of each coordinate and time step and depict them as piled cubes. We highlight only specific cubes so that users can understand the overall tendency of datasets. The other technique provides a route recommendation based on tweets of microblogs. Our technique supports users to explore attractive events and places by selecting effective tweets and suggesting routes. We also developed user interfaces for operating these objects in a VR space which indicate details of tweets. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Springer,,,"Okada K., Yoshida M., Itoh T., Czauderna T., Stephens K.",57201502480;57171240600;35373203100;25925695500;57200282319;,"Okada, K., Ochanomizu University, Tokyo, Japan; Yoshida, M., Toyohashi University of Technology, Aichi, Japan; Itoh, T., Ochanomizu University, Tokyo, Japan; Czauderna, T., Monash University, Clayton, Australia; Stephens, K., Monash University, Clayton, Australia",Multimedia Tools and Applications,Multimedia Tools Appl,
DiseaSE: A biomedical text analytics system for disease symptom extraction and characterization,2019,2-s2.0-85074886243,"Due to increasing volume and unstructured nature of the scientific literatures in biomedical domain, most of the information embedded within them remain untapped. This paper presents a biomedical text analytics system, DiseaSE (Disease Symptom Extraction), to identify and extract disease symptoms and their associations from biomedical text documents retrieved from the PubMed database. It implements various NLP and information extraction techniques to convert text documents into record-size information components that are represented as semantic triples and processed using TextRank and other ranking techniques to identify feasible disease symptoms. Eight different diseases, including dengue, malaria, cholera, diarrhoea, influenza, meningitis, leishmaniasis, and kala-azar are considered for experimental evaluation of the proposed DiseaSE system. On analysis, we found that the DiseaSE system is able to identify new symptoms that are even not catalogued on standard websites such as Center for Disease Control (CDC), World Health Organization (WHO), and National Health Survey (NHS). The proposed DiseaSE system also aims to compile generic associations between a disease and its symptoms, and presents a graph-theoretic analysis and visualization scheme to characterize disease at different levels of granularity. The identified disease symptoms and their associations could be useful to generate a biomedical knowledgebase (e.g., a disease ontology) for the development of e-health and disease surveillance systems. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Academic Press Inc.,,,"Abulaish M., Parwez M.A., Jahiruddin",6505934038;57202719622;35590173900;,"Abulaish, M., Department of Computer Science, South Asian University, Delhi, India; Parwez, M.A., Department of Computer Science, Jamia Millia Islamia, Delhi, India; Jahiruddin, Department of Computer Science, Jamia Millia Islamia, Delhi, India",Journal of Biomedical Informatics,J.

Remote interactive collaboration in facilities management using BIM-based mixed reality,2019,2-s2.0-85071686342,"Facilities Management (FM) day-to-day tasks require suitable methods to facilitate work orders and improve performance by better collaboration between the office and the field. Building Information Modeling (BIM) provides opportunities to support collaboration and to improve the efficiency of Computerized Maintenance Management Systems (CMMSs) by sharing building information between different applications/users throughout the lifecycle of the facility. However, manual retrieval of building element information can be challenging and time consuming for field workers during FM operations. Mixed Reality (MR) is a visualization technique that can be used to improve visual perception of the facility by superimposing 3D virtual objects and textual information on top of the view of real-world building objects. This paper discusses the development of a collaborative BIM-based MR approach to support facilities field tasks. The proposed framework integrates multisource facilities information, BIM models, and feature-based tracking in an MR-based setting to retrieve information based on time (e.g. inspection schedule) and the location of the field worker, visualize inspection and maintenance operations, and support remote collaboration and visual communication between the field worker and the manager at the office. The field worker uses an Augmented Reality (AR) application installed on his/her tablet. The manager at the office uses an Immersive Augmented Virtuality (IAV) application installed on a desktop computer. Based on the field worker location, as well as the inspection or maintenance schedule, the field worker is given work orders and instructions from the office. Other sensory data (e.g., infrared thermography) can provide additional layers of information by augmenting the actual view of the field worker and supporting him/her in making effective decisions about existing and potential problems while communicating with the office in an Interactive Virtual Collaboration (IVC) mode. Finally, to investigate the applicability of the proposed method, a prototype system is developed and tested in a case study. © 2019",Elsevier B.V.,,,"El Ammari K., Hammad A.",14628356000;7006162997;,"El Ammari, K., Department of Building, Civil and Environmental Engineering, Concordia University, Canada; Hammad, A., Concordia Institute for Information Systems Engineering, Concordia University, Canada",Automation in Construction,Autom Constr,4.0
Research on the emergency management pattern and adjustment system for urban waterlogging,2019,2-s2.0-85077803554,"Urban waterlogging events have become more frequent in big cities, causing a considerable economic loss and casualties. Waterlogging disasters exert increasingly severe influences on cities, which has become a research hotspot under changing environment. In view of that problem of insufficient information in the waterlogging emergency management, it is necessary to build emergency management pattern to adapt to the changing environment of urban waterlogging and design support emergency management pattern implementation of adjustment system. Through the process of ""pre-event, in-event and after-event"", a set of emergency pattern is designed to face the urban waterlogging event, which ensures that the management personnel could grasp the state of the occurrence of the event at each stage of the event and take countermeasures for the occurrence of the event quickly. The digitalization and visualization of urban waterlogging emergency management can be realized by using customized components, drawing knowledge map and designing adjustment system. According to the urban waterlogging emergency management pattern, the Beijing emergency plan component and the component based on similar historical case analysis are customized, and the functions of the components are realized through the integrated adjustment system. The application shows that emergency management adjustment system of urban waterlogging can realize the quick use of information, offer users customized waterlogging emergency management services, and provide the management with the support of effective emergency management decision. The results can provide conceptual and technical support for urban emergency management. It can also improve the timeliness of urban response and the level of urban flood control. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",Institute of Physics Publishing,"5th International Conference on Water Resource and Environment, WRE 2019",16 July 2019 through 19 July 2019,"Yang S.Y., Jiang R.G., Xie J.C., Yu X., Liang J.C., Lian Y.N.",57204951915;36656019700;8399981200;57196119394;57204952424;57213421778;,"Yang, S.Y., State Key Laboratory of Eco-hydraulics in Northwest Arid Region of China, Xi'An University of Technology, Xi'an, 710048, China; Jiang, R.G., State Key Laboratory of Eco-hydraulics in Northwest Arid Region of China, Xi'An University of Technology, Xi'an, 710048, China; Xie, J.C., State Key Laboratory of Eco-hydraulics in Northwest Arid Region of China, Xi'An University of Technology, Xi'an, 710048, China; Yu, X., State Key Laboratory of Eco-hydraulics in Northwest Arid Region of China, Xi'An University of Technology, Xi'an, 710048, China; Liang, J.C., State Key Laboratory of Eco-hydraulics in Northwest Arid Region of China, Xi'An University of Technology, Xi'an, 710048, China; Lian, Y.N., State Key Laboratory of Eco-hydraulics in Northwest Arid Region of China, Xi'An University of Technology, Xi'an, 710048, China",IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science,IOP Conf.

Development of methods and tools to support regional management in the Arctic zone of the Russian Federation based on cognitive interfaces,2019,2-s2.0-85071875225,"This article discusses the creation of methods and tools for decision-making information support for regional management systems in the context of ensuring environmental and technological security in the Arctic region. To implement information support for regional management, we propose to use information technology for spatial data visualization. This technology is used to synthesize cognitive interfaces of multi-subject information systems supporting regional management in the Arctic zone of the Russian Federation. The article describes the methodological support, composition and structure of information technology to identify implicit conflicts of environmental management based on the use of methods of conceptual and ontological modeling of the subject area, system analysis and theory of management of complex systems. The key elements of the technology are the conceptual model of the conflict situation of environmental management, the ontology of the subject area, the knowledge base and the cognitive user interface of the multi-subject information regional management support system for the Arctic territories. A brief classification of conflicts among the stakeholders of the Arctic region (using the example of the Murmansk region) is also described.

Analysis of server-side and client-side Web-GIS data processing methods on the example of JTS and JSTS using open data from OSM and geoportal,2019,2-s2.0-85066064473,"The last decade has seen a rapid evolution of processing, analysis and visualization of freely available geographic data using Open Source Web-GIS. In the beginning, Web-based Geographic Information Systems employed a thick-client approach which required installation of platform-specific browser plugins. Later on, research focus shifted to platform-independent thin client solutions in which data processing and analysis was performed by the server machine. More recently, however, the rapid development of computer hardware as well as software technologies such has HTML5 has enabled the creation of platform-independent thick clients which offer advanced GIS functionalities such as geoprocessing. This article aims to analyse the current state of Open Source technologies and publicly available geographic data sources in the context of creating cost-effective Web-GIS applications for integration and processing of spatial data. For this purpose the article discusses the availability and potential of Web-GIS architectures, software libraries and data sources. The analysis of freely available data sources includes a discussion of the quality and accuracy of crowd-sourced as well as public sector data, while the investigation of software libraries and architectures involves a comparison of server-side and client-side data processing performance under a set of real-world scenarios.

AltEx: An open source web application and toolkit for accessing and exploring altimetry datasets,2019,2-s2.0-85063859157,"Understanding the spatial and temporal distribution of hydrologic variables, such as streamflow, is important for sustainable development, especially with global population growth and climate variations. Typical monitoring of streamflow is conducted using in situ gauging stations; however, stations are costly to setup and maintain, leading to data gaps in regions that cannot afford gauges. Satellite data, including altimetry data, are used to supplement in situ observations and in some cases supply information where they are lacking. This study introduces an open-source web application to access and explore altimetry datasets for use in water level monitoring, named the Altimetry Explorer (AltEx). This web application, along with its relevant REST API, facilitates access to altimetry data for analysis, visualization, and impact. The data provided through AltEx is validated using thirteen gauges in the Amazon Basin from 2008 to 2018 with an average Nash-Sutcliffe Coefficient and root mean square error of 0.78 and 1.2 m, respectively. Access to global water level data should be particularly helpful for water resource practitioners and researchers seeking to understand the long-term trends and dynamics of global water level and availability. This work provides an initial framework for a more robust and comprehensive platform to access future altimetry datasets and support research related to global water resources. © 2019 The Authors",Elsevier Ltd,,,"Markert K.N., Pulla S.T., Lee H., Markert A.M., Anderson E.R., Okeowo M.A., Limaye A.S.",57201030837;57208132039;14031725600;57208123780;35291520900;57193082748;57210803755;,"Markert, K.N., Earth System Science Center, The University of Alabama in Huntsville, Huntsville, AL, United States, SERVIR Science Coordination Office, NASA Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, AL, United States; Pulla, S.T., SERVIR Science Coordination Office, NASA Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, AL, United States; Lee, H., Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Houston, Houston, TX, United States, National Center for Airborne Laser Mapping, University of Houston, Houston, TX, United States; Markert, A.M., Earth System Science Center, The University of Alabama in Huntsville, Huntsville, AL, United States, SERVIR Science Coordination Office, NASA Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, AL, United States; Anderson, E.R., Earth System Science Center, The University of Alabama in Huntsville, Huntsville, AL, United States, SERVIR Science Coordination Office, NASA Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, AL, United States; Okeowo, M.A., Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Houston, Houston, TX, United States, National Center for Airborne Laser Mapping, University of Houston, Houston, TX, United States; Limaye, A.S., SERVIR Science Coordination Office, NASA Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, AL, United States",Environmental Modelling and Software,Environ.

Spatial and temporal processes visualization for marine environmental data using particle system,2019,2-s2.0-85063078841,"Many observation methods have been employed to monitor the changes in the ecological environment. Marine environment monitoring data have characteristics of complex diversity, high spatial-resolution, high time-frequency, and multi-level free-surface depth. In this study, we constructed a three-dimensional temporal-spatial visualization model to express the spatial-temporal variations using particle system. For the temporal dimension, we visualized the dynamic real-time changes by changing properties such as particle color, displacement, and size by calculating the difference between the data at adjacent points in time in different frames. To achieve high quality dynamic display, we introduced the CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) parallel computing model to realize large-scale particle change visualization. This model reduced the CPU load and significantly improved the frame rate. Moreover, this model provides virtual simulation and user interaction rendering, which can dynamically change the environment data type, rendering mode, drawing profiles, and other functions.

An efficient computerized decision support system for the analysis and 3D visualization of brain tumor,2019,2-s2.0-85048596114,"The quality of health services provided by medical centers varies widely, and there is often a large gap between the optimal standard of services when judged based on the locality of patients (rural or urban environments). This quality gap can have serious health consequences and major implications for patient’s timely and correct treatment. These deficiencies can manifest, for example, as a lack of quality services, misdiagnosis, medication errors, and unavailability of trained professionals. In medical imaging, MRI analysis assists radiologists and surgeons in developing patient treatment plans. Accurate segmentation of anomalous tissues and its correct 3D visualization plays an important role inappropriate treatment. In this context, we aim to develop an intelligent computer-aided diagnostic system focusing on human brain MRI analysis. We present brain tumor detection, segmentation, and its 3D visualization system, providing quality clinical services, regardless of geographical location, and level of expertise of medical specialists. In this research, brain magnetic resonance (MR) images are segmented using a semi-automatic and adaptive threshold selection method. After segmentation, the tumor is classified into malignant and benign based on a bag of words (BoW) driven robust support vector machine (SVM) classification model. The BoW feature extraction method is further amplified via speeded up robust features (SURF) incorporating its procedure of interest point selection. Finally, 3D visualization of the brain and tumor is achieved using volume marching cube algorithm which is used for rendering medical data.

Building information modelling for off-site construction: Review and future directions,2019,2-s2.0-85060755230,"Building Information Modelling (BIM) and off-site construction (OSC) are increasingly applied in the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry due to their many benefits to project stakeholders, such as enhanced design visualization, improved data exchanges, reduced construction waste, improved productivity, and higher product quality. Substantial research efforts have thus been devoted to these topics in recent decades, resulting in a large amount of literature regarding BIM and OSC. This research explores the state-of-the-art in BIM for OSC by means of a bibliometric-qualitative review method. The objective of this research is to uncover the synthesis between BIM and OSC and to identify research trends as well as gaps in knowledge that can be addressed in future research on BIM for OSC. Science maps are constructed by means of bibliometric analysis in order to objectively identify the main research topics of these two fields both separately and jointly based on identified academic publications from Scopus (i.e., 4395 publications on BIM, 2841 publications on OSC, and 113 publications on BIM for OSC). A qualitative review is further conducted on 77 screened research publications (including articles, reviews, conference papers) with a particular focus on BIM for OSC. Through quantitative analysis and in-depth discussion of BIM for OSC, research gaps are identified, and future directions are further proposed as follows: BIM-based generative design for prefabrication, cloud BIM-based data exchange for OSC, robotics and 3D printing for OSC, BIM-enabled big data analytics toward best OSC practice, benefits and its assessment model of BIM for OSC. This research contributes to the body of knowledge by synthesizing the state of the art of BIM for OSC and exposing the research needs in this area in order to improve AEC practice. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Elsevier B.V.,,,"Yin X., Liu H., Chen Y., Al-Hussein M.",57204697057;53984550800;55642611800;6603541102;,"Yin, X., Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta  T6G 1H9, Canada; Liu, H., Department of Civil and Construction Engineering, Western Michigan University, Kalamazoo, MI  49008-5316, United States; Chen, Y., Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta  T6G 1H9, Canada; Al-Hussein, M., Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta  T6G 1H9, Canada",Automation in Construction,Autom Constr,19.0

(re)Considering Bertin in the age of big data and visual analytics,2019,2-s2.0-85054900269,"This paper highlights a selection of core ideas articulated by Bertin and leveraged by many researchers over time, with particular attention to how the ideas relate to developments in cartography, big data, and visual analytics. A primary contribution is a bibliometric analysis of the impact of Bertin’s Semiology of Graphics at its 50th anniversary. A briefer bibliometric assessment of Graphics and Graphic Information Processing impacts is also provided. The bibliometric analysis includes exploration of citations to Semiology of Graphics over the entire time span (in both English and French editions) as well as more focused analysis by topic and outlet since the advent of visual analytics as a research domain. Then, very recent research related to cartography, visual analytics, and big data is examined in detail to determine if and how Bertin’s ideas continue to be leveraged and extended for current data representation and analysis challenges. After outlining some limitations of the bibliometric analysis, discussion reflects on the current relevance of Bertin’s ideas, potential applications in visual analytics, and the need for a complement to Sémiologie Graphique focused on interactive visual interfaces to an increasingly diverse array of display forms.

Algorithm for quantitative analysis of close call events and personalized feedback in construction safety,2019,2-s2.0-85058785147,"In many of the developed countries about 15–25% of all fatal construction workplace accidents relate to a too close proximity of pedestrian workers to construction equipment or hazardous materials. Extracting knowledge from data on near hits (aka. close calls) might warrant better understanding on the root causes that lead to such incidents and eliminate them early in the risk mitigation process. While a close call is a subtle event where workers are in close proximity to a hazard, its frequency depends–among other factors–on poor site layout, a worker's willingness to take risks, limited safety education, and pure coincidence. For these reasons, pioneering organizations have recognized the potential of gathering and analyzing leading indicator data on close calls. However, mostly manual approaches are infrequently performed, subjective due to situational assessment, imprecise in level of detail, and importantly, reactive or inconsistent in effective or timely follow-ups by management. While existing predictive analytics research targets change at strategic levels in the hierarchy of organizations, personalized feedback to strengthen an individual worker's hazard recognition and avoidance skill set is yet missing. This study tackles the bottom of Heinrich's safety pyramid by providing an in-depth quantitative analysis of close calls. Modern positioning technology records trajectory data, whereas computational algorithms automatically generate previously unavailable details to close call events. The derived information is embedded in simplified geometric information models that users on a construction site can retrieve, easily understand, and adapt in existing preventative hazard recognition and control processes. Results from scientific and field experiments demonstrate that the developed system works successfully under the constraints of currently available positioning technology. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Elsevier B.V.,,,"Golovina O., Perschewski M., Teizer J., König M.",56431008400;57196246369;12753630700;8883542500;,"Golovina, O., Ruhr-University Bochum, Universitätstrasse 150, Bochum, 44801, Germany; Perschewski, M., Ruhr-University Bochum, Universitätstrasse 150, Bochum, 44801, Germany; Teizer, J., Ruhr-University Bochum, Universitätstrasse 150, Bochum, 44801, Germany; König, M., Ruhr-University Bochum, Universitätstrasse 150, Bochum, 44801, Germany",Automation in Construction,Autom Constr,3.0
Visualization of carbon monoxide particles released from firearms,2019,2-s2.0-85080099656,"A significant number of soldiers have come forward to report discomfort, irritation, and respiratory problems after taking part in live firing sessions. These problems appear to be caused due to the fumes and particulates emitted from the gun upon firing. There exists substantial research focused on lead and other harmful metallic particulates expelled from a firearm as those are considered the most harmful among the emissions. However, our research focuses on visualizing the carbon monoxide (CO) particles released from a firearm to improve our understanding of their adverse effects on the human body. We use data provided by researchers at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base (WPAFB) enhanced with analyses of provided video material to devise a visualization that shows the correlations between the concentration of CO particles and Lung Deposited Surface Area (LDSA) values as well as other relevant parameters. The results are summarized in the form of a dynamic parallel coordinates plots for in-depth analysis by the domain specialists. Results of this study may be used to glean information about the interrelation between CO particles released and health issues faced by individuals after firing a weapon during a training exercise. © 2019, Society for Imaging Science and Technology.",Society for Imaging Science and Technology,"2019 Conference on Visualization and Data Analysis, VDA 2019",13 January 2019 through 17 January 2019,"Menon S.S., Wischgoll T.",57215199843;16240506100;,"Menon, S.S., Wright State University, Dayton, OH, United States; Wischgoll, T., Wright State University, Dayton, OH, United States",IS and T International Symposium on Electronic Imaging Science and Technology,IS T Intl.

Dynamic color mapping with a multi-scale histogram: A design study with physical scientists,2019,2-s2.0-85080075264,"Many research and development activities for scientific data analysis have focused on scalability challenges and data-driven features. Conversely, data visualization that focuses on models requiring human interaction rarely involve practical and largescale scientific data analysis. Therefore, a gap exists between interactive data visualization and scientific data analysis applications. In this paper, we present a design study of interactive data visualization to support scientists who visually analyze data from neutron scattering experiments. This study was conducted in multiple phases: 1) problem characterization; 2) initial design and formative evaluation; and 3) iterative design. We characterize the problems and the design requirements for the analysis of the specific physical science data. We discuss the design, development, evaluation of our visual analytics tool and as well as our iterative developments with physical scientists. We show how to bridge the gap between the two disciplines uncovering new potential to solve their challenges in this design study. We focus on a specific challenge, finding an optimal color mapping, which plays a critical role in neutron scattering science and is broadly applicable to other scientific domains. To address the challenge, we propose two interactive visualization techniques: a dynamic color scale bar (DCSB) and a multi-scale histogram (MSH). © 2019 Society for Imaging Science and Technology.

Cartographic bases of the multi-subject method of information visualization in the preparation of bachelors in the direction of “Tourism”,2019,2-s2.0-85073393862,"The article deals with issues related to the use of a universal multi-subject mapping method belonging to the technology of visualization of educational information in the preparation of bachelors. The cartographic method of teaching is characteristic in that it allows you to visualize both the geographic proper and any simulated space, to investigate, first of all, its spatial structural patterns of the structure (the form often determines the content). In the process of learning, the use of the cartographic method, the techniques of visualization, the study of the spatial regularities of the object being studied, respectively, develops spatial thinking, activating both hemispheres of the brain, integrates the artistic and logical components of cognition. The symbolic figurative language of a geographic map contributes to the formation of an abstract representation of the prototype, which actually exists in reality and is presented in a model, reduced graphic image-an intermediary between the real object and its researcher. With the development of the cartographic method of teaching, its application in the training of specialists in higher education, bachelors, it is safe to say that the cartographic method is a metamethod for any sciences or activities that study the spatial and temporal distribution of phenomena or objects that contribute to the development of professional intellectual and graphic competence when teaching in high school. The cartographic method can be defined as a system of cartographic forms of logical methods of knowledge. The first model of a territorial system is usually an idea of it, obtained through direct observation. The system-analogue is the group of brain neurons united by a set of connections. Subsequently, the presentation can be expressed in the form of a description, drawing, scheme, photo, map. The article shows the methodological role of cartographic knowledge and skills, their methodological belonging to the intellectual-graphic competence. When developing the psychological and pedagogical foundations for the introduction and development of cartographic training in higher education in various subject areas, one of the central places is occupied by the study of the role of images in teaching and the development of spatial thinking. Many psychologists believe that the terms “image”, “representation”, “mental picture” are synonymous and that image is visual knowledge. Spatial thinking is part of the imaginative, right-hemispheric, which is considered one of the main mechanisms of intuition, collapsed, operating images based on visual material. Developed spatial thinking helps to be successful in many activities: designing, visual, modeling. The theory of interaction comes from the fact that visual literacy is possible only when the subject of perception is able to creatively use visual material within the framework of the functional situation and his own vision of the world. © 2019, International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference.

The method of dynamic visualization of spatial data for cognitive interfaces of information systems supporting regional management,2019,2-s2.0-85073324217,"The purpose of our research is to develop methods, models and algorithms of cognitive geovisualization for regional management support systems. The paper describes the information technology of automated synthesis of cognitive user interface. The cognitive interface increases the efficiency of working with space-time data when solving spatial planning tasks. We used the methods of system analysis, conceptual modeling and ontological design of subject area. Special attention was paid to the issues of user interaction with the information system and the problem of cognitive user overload. As a result, the method of dynamic visualization of spatial data for cognitive interfaces of regional management support systems was developed. This method allows you to visualize space-time data, taking into account the context of the visual data analysis task. A feature of the method is the ability to adapt the resulting geo-images taking into account the peculiarities of visual information perception by the end user. For this purpose, special algorithms were developed that allow to take into account the semantic description of objects of visualization. The developed method can be used to implement cognitive interfaces in information systems supporting regional management and spatial planning. © SGEM 2019.",International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference,"19th International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference, SGEM 2019",30 June 2019 through 6 July 2019,"Vicentiy A., Vicentiy I.",57189029589;57194096523;,"Vicentiy, A., Institute for Informatics and Mathematical Modeling, Subdivision of the Federal Research Centre, Kola Science Centre of the Russian Academy of Science, Russian Federation, Apatity branch of Murmansk Arctic State University, Russian Federation; Vicentiy, I., Apatity branch of Murmansk Arctic State University, Russian Federation","International Multidisciplinary Scientific GeoConference Surveying Geology and Mining Ecology Management, SGEM","Int.

Algorithm for selection of visualization components in the synthesis of training complexes,2019,2-s2.0-85073363313,"An urgent problem in the design of adaptive training complexes (ATC) is to find the optimal set of visualization tools and technologies. Currently, there is a wide variety of visualization components on the market, so it is impossible to choose the best solution at the moment. At the design stage, the traditional expert approach is currently the most widespread. However, it is subjective, not accurate enough, and the resulting solution is not always optimal. Therefore, this article discusses the method of selection of visualization components, formalized with the help of functional diagrams. The necessary mathematical support allowing to carry out classification of components and a choice of the best option from group is given. Visualization components are analyzed and grouped into a classification system based on the facet method.

Information system for research and forecasting the results of matches of football teams of the Russian premier league,2019,2-s2.0-85073347935,"The purpose of this study is to create an information system that allows for predicting the results of football matches primarily focusing on teams in the Russian Premier League (RPL). To predict the results of matches it is possible to use various approaches that take into account a large number of different factors. This work is devoted to the study of patterns of outcomes of matches, depending on the place occupied by a team in the championship. During the season, teams can occupy the predicted and desired place, or some other not so good place. In this regard, the tactics of preparation and participation of teams in competitions for the whole season or a certain segment of it may change. As practice shows, the most significant for forecasting are the last 5 seasons. In the presented work, an information system was created, including a database of the position of all teams in the RPL standings at the time of each round for the last season and for the 4 previous seasons. To study and establish patterns were selected 3 teams. To interpret the information, the system includes means of primary processing and visualization of data in the form of graphs, which reflect the dynamics of the indicators of three selected RPL teams in the standings over five seasons.

Software for processing and visualization of measurements of the deformation of the Earth's crust,2019,2-s2.0-85073353158,"Regular measurement of rock deformation processes makes it possible to make judgments about the nature of the deformations of the Earth's crust, as well as the likely precursors of earthquakes near the area where these data are obtained. Therefore, the continuous operation of measuring devices that record such deformations is extremely important. When measuring by laser methods in a normal atmosphere, the distance of measurements can be significant, up to 25 meters and higher. The disadvantage of such measurements is the possible influence of the atmosphere; however, this effect can be eliminated only by providing a vacuum overall measuring shoulder, which is impossible to provide on such long measuring bases. If, however, the measuring shoulder is small, less than one meter, then the measured increments will be so small that their reliable measurement is impossible. Therefore, laser meters operating in atmospheric conditions with large distances are the most effective means of detecting deformations. At the same time, the elimination of the influence of the atmosphere can be achieved by measuring in two orthogonal directions, by using a comparison of measurement results with a standard, by taking into account temperature, humidity and other tricks. This places great demands on the software used to process the signals received from the meter. In addition, the software should provide data compression and primary processing, as well as visualization of current and recent measurement results for prompt decision making on the situation. This paper describes a new software for processing deformation signals received from a laser meter installed at the Talaya Observatory in the Baikal rift zone. © SGEM 2019.",International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference,"19th International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference, SGEM 2019",30 June 2019 through 6 July 2019,"Zhmud V., Semibalamut V., Dimitrov L., Tereshkin D., Fomin Y.",6602329136;6507551266;43060962600;55243383400;8890861400;,"Zhmud, V., Novosibirsk State Technical University, Russian Federation; Semibalamut, V., Siberian Branch of the Federal Research Center unified geophysical service of the Russian, Academy of Sciences (SIBGSRAS), Novosibirsk, Russian Federation; Dimitrov, L., Technical University of Sofia, Bulgaria; Tereshkin, D., Institute of Laser Physics SB RAS, Russian Federation; Fomin, Y., Siberian Branch of the Federal Research Center unified geophysical service of the Russian, Academy of Sciences (SIBGSRAS), Novosibirsk, Russian Federation","International Multidisciplinary Scientific GeoConference Surveying Geology and Mining Ecology Management, SGEM","Int.

Viscrimepredict: A System for Crime Trajectory Prediction and Visualisation from Heterogeneous data sources,2019,2-s2.0-85065667658,"Open multidimensional data from social media and similar sources often carries insightful information on social issues. With the increase of high volume data and the proliferation of visual analytics platforms, it becomes easier for users to interact with and select meaningful information from large data sets. The prevention of crime is a crucial issue for law-enforcing agencies tasked with maintaining societal stability. The ability to visualise crime patterns and predict imminent incidents accurately opens new possibilities in crime prevention. In this paper, we present VisCrimePredict, a system that uses visual and predictive analytics to map out crimes that occurred in a region/neighbourhood. VisCrimePredict is underpinned by a novel algorithm that creates trajectories from heterogeneous data sources such as open data and social media with the aim to report incidents of crime.

Moodplay: Interactive music recommendation based on Artists’ mood similarity,2019,2-s2.0-85046748820,"A large amount of research in recommender systems focuses on algorithmic accuracy and optimization of ranking metrics. However, recent work has unveiled the importance of other aspects of the recommendation process, including explanation, transparency, control and user experience in general. Building on these aspects, this paper introduces MoodPlay, an interactive music-artists recommender system which integrates content and mood-based filtering in a novel interface. We show how MoodPlay allows the user to explore a music collection by musical mood dimensions, building upon GEMS, a music-specific model of affect, rather than the traditional Circumplex model. We describe system architecture, algorithms, interface and interactions followed by use-case and offline evaluations of the system, providing evidence of the benefits of our model based on similarities between the typical moods found in an artist's music, for contextual music recommendation. Finally, we present results of a user study (N = 279) in which four versions of the interface are evaluated with varying degrees of visualization and interaction. Results show that our proposed visualization of items and mood information improves user acceptance and understanding of both the underlying data and the recommendations. Furthermore, our analysis reveals the role of mood in music recommendation, considering both artists’ mood and users’ self-reported mood in the user study. Our results and discussion highlight the impact of visual and interactive features in music recommendation, as well as associated human-cognitive limitations. This research also aims to inform the design of future interactive recommendation systems. © 2018",Academic Press,,,"Andjelkovic I., Parra D., O'Donovan J.",57190977894;57188533542;55387242800;,"Andjelkovic, I., University of California - Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA  93106, United States; Parra, D., Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Vicuña Mackenna, Santiago, 4860, Chile; O'Donovan, J., University of California - Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA  93106, United States",International Journal of Human Computer Studies,Int J Hum Comput Stud,9.0
Determining burried remains under the ala gate road of anavarza ancient city in the southern of turkey with interactive transparent 3D GPR data imaging,2019,2-s2.0-85073695607,"Anavarza (Anazarvus) ancient city has been established on an area of 143,000 m2 with a castle, stadium, ancient theater, mosaics, bathes, churches, gates of victory, aqueducts and stone graves. It is the largest ancient city in Anatolia. Anavarza City of Antiquity is situated near Dilekkaya village of the Kozan County, and it is approximately 70 kilometres to Adana city centre (Turkey). The history of the Anavarza goes back to 2100 years, and it has became the capital of Cilicia in 408. Archaeological excavations in the ancient city Anavarza in the southern province of Adana’s Kozan district are continuing on a 30-35 meter-wide cobblestone road. The aim of the study is to discover the buried archaeological remains along the Colonnaded Street of Ala Gate of Anavarza city using interactive transparent 2D/3D GPR data visualization, and also develop visualization quality removing clutter effects with applying to predictive deconvolution. We used 250 MHz shielded antenna with a Ramac CU II GPR system. Size of the area was about 276x14m. We had 277 profiles spaced 1.0 m apart. Start time correction, de-wow and background removal were applied to all of the profiles. Amplitude attenuations were balanced using our gain approximation and the second-order band-pass Butterworth filter was applied. After velocity analysis by matching with diffraction patterns throughout the profiles, the mean velocity of the electromagnetic (EM) wave was determined by averaging as 0.1 m/ns. Then predictive deconvolution was applied to remove vertical noise which are clutter effect of cobblestone and tail of the source wavelet. We indicated 2D processed radargrams and their interactive 3D half bird’s eye views of the depth slices of the GPR profile data set including 277 profiles. The results of the 2D profile sections and interactive 3D time slices indicated that the deconvolved data was cleaned from the source wavelet multiples and revealed the buried important archaeological structures. © SGEM2019.",International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference,"19th International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference, SGEM 2019",30 June 2019 through 6 July 2019,"Kadioglu S., Kağan Kadioğlu Y.",16549490300;15019389800;,"Kadioglu, S., Ankara University, Faculty of Engineering, Department of Geoph.

A comparison of word embeddings for the biomedical natural language processing,2018,2-s2.0-85054036088,"Background: Word embeddings have been prevalently used in biomedical Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications due to the ability of the vector representations being able to capture useful semantic properties and linguistic relationships between words. Different textual resources (e.g., Wikipedia and biomedical literature corpus) have been utilized in biomedical NLP to train word embeddings and these word embeddings have been commonly leveraged as feature input to downstream machine learning models. However, there has been little work on evaluating the word embeddings trained from different textual resources. Methods: In this study, we empirically evaluated word embeddings trained from four different corpora, namely clinical notes, biomedical publications, Wikipedia, and news. For the former two resources, we trained word embeddings using unstructured electronic health record (EHR) data available at Mayo Clinic and articles (MedLit) from PubMed Central, respectively. For the latter two resources, we used publicly available pre-trained word embeddings, GloVe and Google News. The evaluation was done qualitatively and quantitatively. For the qualitative evaluation, we randomly selected medical terms from three categories (i.e., disorder, symptom, and drug), and manually inspected the five most similar words computed by embeddings for each term. We also analyzed the word embeddings through a 2-dimensional visualization plot of 377 medical terms. For the quantitative evaluation, we conducted both intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation. For the intrinsic evaluation, we evaluated the word embeddings’ ability to capture medical semantics by measruing the semantic similarity between medical terms using four published datasets: Pedersen's dataset, Hliaoutakis's dataset, MayoSRS, and UMNSRS. For the extrinsic evaluation, we applied word embeddings to multiple downstream biomedical NLP applications, including clinical information extraction (IE), biomedical information retrieval (IR), and relation extraction (RE), with data from shared tasks. Results: The qualitative evaluation shows that the word embeddings trained from EHR and MedLit can find more similar medical terms than those trained from GloVe and Google News. The intrinsic quantitative evaluation verifies that the semantic similarity captured by the word embeddings trained from EHR is closer to human experts’ judgments on all four tested datasets. The extrinsic quantitative evaluation shows that the word embeddings trained on EHR achieved the best F1 score of 0.900 for the clinical IE task; no word embeddings improved the performance for the biomedical IR task; and the word embeddings trained on Google News had the best overall F1 score of 0.790 for the RE task. Conclusion: Based on the evaluation results, we can draw the following conclusions. First, the word embeddings trained from EHR and MedLit can capture the semantics of medical terms better, and find semantically relevant medical terms closer to human experts’ judgments than those trained from GloVe and Google News. Second, there does not exist a consistent global ranking of word embeddings for all downstream biomedical NLP applications. However, adding word embeddings as extra features will improve results on most downstream tasks. Finally, the word embeddings trained from the biomedical domain corpora do not necessarily have better performance than those trained from the general domain corpora for any downstream biomedical NLP task. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Academic Press Inc.,,,"Wang Y., Liu S., Afzal N., Rastegar-Mojarad M., Wang L., Shen F., Kingsbury P., Liu H.",55246542700;57196071898;57188805324;55995663400;56044356400;55813011500;57201746983;7409753328;,"Wang, Y., Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, United States; Liu, S., Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, United States; Afzal, N., Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, United States; Rastegar-Mojarad, M., Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, United States; Wang, L., Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, United States; Shen, F., Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, United States; Kingsbury, P., Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, United States; Liu, H., Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, United States",Journal of Biomedical Informatics,J.

Evaluation of Convolutional Neural Network Architectures for Chart Image Classification,2018,2-s2.0-85056555992,"Many information visualization techniques map abstract data into visual representations to present the underlying information in a more understandable way. However, when data is not available, automatic methods are necessary to extract the underlying data from the chart images. This paper focuses on chart image classification, which is a fundamental step of chart analysis and data extraction. The performance of most conventional classifiers depends on the feature extraction technique applied, usually requiring a domain-specific design for creating the features. In this context, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has gained attention not only because it has achieved good results in many computer vision tasks but also because it can learn representations of images without the design of a feature extractor specific for a domain problem. Thereby, this paper proposes an evaluation of CNN architectures (VGG19, Resnet-50, and Inception-V3), comparing them with conventional classifiers (HOG features combined with KNN, Naive Bayes, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine). An artificially generated dataset of 10 classes of chart images was used for training and testing. Furthermore, another dataset composed of chart images collected from the internet was used for validation. The results show that Resnet-50 and Inception-V3 performed best achieving an accuracy of 77.76% and 76.77% respectively on the validation set. The CNN models outperformed the conventional methods, where the best combination was HOG+SVM, achieving 45.03 %. Moreover, some similar chart types were expected to be misclassified, and they were discussed based on the confusion matrix. © 2018 IEEE.",Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"2018 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, IJCNN 2018",8 July 2018 through 13 July 2018,"Chagas P., Akiyama R., Meiguins A., Santos C., Saraiva F., Meiguins B., Morais J.",57191849627;57204638514;22835623800;35180344300;57189248122;6506654143;24483494000;,"Chagas, P., Programa de Pós-graduação em Ciência da Computação, Universidade Federal Do Pará, Belém, Pará, Brazil; Akiyama, R., Programa de Pós-graduação em Ciência da Computação, Universidade Federal Do Pará, Belém, Pará, Brazil; Meiguins, A., Programa de Pós-graduação em Ciência da Computação, Universidade Federal Do Pará, Belém, Pará, Brazil; Santos, C., Programa de Pós-graduação em Ciência da Computação, Universidade Federal Do Pará, Belém, Pará, Brazil; Saraiva, F., Programa de Pós-graduação em Ciência da Computação, Universidade Federal Do Pará, Belém, Pará, Brazil; Meiguins, B., Programa de Pós-graduação em Ciência da Computação, Universidade Federal Do Pará, Belém, Pará, Brazil; Morais, J., Programa de Pós-graduação em Ciência da Computação, Universidade Federal Do Pará, Belém, Pará, Brazil",Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks,Proc Int Jt Conf Neural Networks,2.0
A comprehensive graphical modeling platform designed for integrated hydrological simulation,2018,2-s2.0-85053193314,"This study developed a comprehensive graphical data processing and modeling system named Visual HEIFLOW (VHF) for integrated surface water-groundwater modeling.

First, VHF uses a generic multivariable-space-time data cube model, which enables the system to efficiently handle large time-series datasets over a large spatial domain. Second, VHF streamlines the entire modeling procedure from data preparation at the very beginning to visualization and analysis of modeling results in a uniform environment. Third, VHF allows updating the land use input at user-specified time points without manual intervention and therefore allows a direct simulation of the hydrological effects of changing land use. The applicability and versatility of VHF were demonstrated in a case study in the Heihe River Basin, the second largest inland river basin in China.

SensePlace3: a geovisual framework to analyze place–time–attribute information in social media,2018,2-s2.0-85029416722,"SensePlace3 (SP3) is a geovisual analytics framework and web application that supports overview + detail analysis of social media, focusing on extracting meaningful information from the Twitterverse. SP3 leverages social media related to crisis events. It differs from most existing systems by enabling an analyst to obtain place-relevant information from tweets that have implicit as well as explicit geography. Specifically, SP3 includes not just the ability to utilize the explicit geography of geolocated tweets but also analyze implicit geography by recognizing and geolocating references in both tweet text, which indicates locations tweeted about, and in Twitter profiles, which indicates locations affiliated with users. Key features of SP3 reported here include flexible search and filtering capabilities to support information foraging; an ingest, processing, and indexing pipeline that produces near real-time access for big streaming data; and a novel strategy for implementing a web-based multi-view visual interface with dynamic linking of entities across views. The SP3 system architecture was designed to support crisis management applications, but its design flexibility makes it easily adaptable to other domains. We also report on a user study that provided input to SP3 interface design and suggests next steps for effective spatiotemporal analytics using social media sources. © 2017, © 2017 Cartography and Geographic Information Society.",Taylor and Francis Inc.,,,"Pezanowski S., MacEachren A.M., Savelyev A., Robinson A.C.",16643655200;7004102300;57192936911;8842250100;,"Pezanowski, S., GeoVISTA Center, Department of Geography, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, United States; MacEachren, A.M., GeoVISTA Center, Department of Geography, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, United States; Savelyev, A., Department of Geography, Texas State University, San Marcos, United States; Robinson, A.C., GeoVISTA Center, Department of Geography, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, United States",Cartography and Geographic Information Science,Cartogr.

An online tool for measuring and visualizing phenotype similarities using HPO,2018,2-s2.0-85051602278,"Background: The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) is one of the most popular bioinformatics resources. Recently, HPO-based phenotype semantic similarity has been effectively applied to model patient phenotype data. However, the existing tools are revised based on the Gene Ontology (GO)-based term similarity. The design of the models are not optimized for the unique features of HPO. In addition, existing tools only allow HPO terms as input and only provide pure text-based outputs. Results: We present PhenoSimWeb, a web application that allows researchers to measure HPO-based phenotype semantic similarities using four approaches borrowed from GO-based similarity measurements. Besides, we provide a approach considering the unique properties of HPO. And, PhenoSimWeb allows text that describes phenotypes as input, since clinical phenotype data is always in text. PhenoSimWeb also provides a graphic visualization interface to visualize the resulting phenotype network. Conclusions:PhenoSimWeb is an easy-to-use and functional online application. Researchers can use it to calculate phenotype similarity conveniently, predict phenotype associated genes or diseases, and visualize the network of phenotype interactions.

Understanding data dimensions by cluster visualization using edge bundling in parallel coordinates,2018,2-s2.0-85050561713,"This paper proposes an edge bundling approach to parallel coordinates to improve the visualization of data dimensions using cluster characteristics. The proposed edge bundling technique visually encodes the clusters information of each dimension, such as variance, means, and quartiles, into the curvature of lines. Each line is decomposed into multiple Bézier curves, in a way that instances belonging to the same cluster are bundled in a single curve, aiming to improve the user perception of the data. The hypothesis is that the proposed technique improves the interpretability of the data in each dimension and their relations between dimensions. Quantitative and qualitative tests were performed with participants to compare the proposed approach with the classical parallel coordinates and with another bundling technique.

Ontology-driven development of web services to support district energy applications,2018,2-s2.0-85035070789,"Current urban and district energy management systems lack a common semantic referential for effectively interrelating intelligent sensing, data models and energy models with visualization, analysis and decision support tools. This paper describes the structure, as well as the rationale that led to this structure, of an ontology that captures the real-world concepts of a district energy system, such as a district heating and cooling system. This ontology (called ee-district ontology) is intended to support knowledge provision that can play the role of an intermediate layer between high-level energy management software applications and local monitoring and control software components. In order to achieve that goal, the authors propose to encapsulate queries to the ontology in a scalable web service, which will facilitate the development of interfaces for third-party applications. Considering the size of the ee-district ontology once populated with data from a specific district case study, this could prove to be a repetitive and time-consuming task for the software developer. This paper therefore assesses the feasibility of ontology-driven automation of web service development that is to be a core element in the deployment of heterogeneous district-wide energy management software. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Elsevier B.V.,,,"Hippolyte J.-L., Rezgui Y., Li H., Jayan B., Howell S.",19638523800;6701829347;35194314500;56104728000;56367541100;,"Hippolyte, J.-L., BRE Trust Centre for Sustainable Engineering, Cardiff School of Engineering, Queen's Buildings, The Parade, Cardiff, CF24 3AA, United Kingdom; Rezgui, Y., BRE Trust Centre for Sustainable Engineering, Cardiff School of Engineering, Queen's Buildings, The Parade, Cardiff, CF24 3AA, United Kingdom; Li, H., BRE Trust Centre for Sustainable Engineering, Cardiff School of Engineering, Queen's Buildings, The Parade, Cardiff, CF24 3AA, United Kingdom; Jayan, B., BRE Trust Centre for Sustainable Engineering, Cardiff School of Engineering, Queen's Buildings, The Parade, Cardiff, CF24 3AA, United Kingdom; Howell, S., BRE Trust Centre for Sustainable Engineering, Cardiff School of Engineering, Queen's Buildings, The Parade, Cardiff, CF24 3AA, United Kingdom",Automation in Construction,Autom Constr,6.0
Performance evaluation of 3D descriptors for object recognition in construction applications,2018,2-s2.0-85032924683,"3D object recognition from field-acquired point cloud data is important for modeling, manipulation, visualization and other post-processing tasks in the construction domain. However, building semantically-rich models from raw point cloud data is a difficult task due to the high volume of unstructured information as well as confounding factors such as noise and occlusion. Although there exist several computational recognition methods available, their performance robustness for construction applications are not well known. Therefore, this research aims to review and evaluate state-of-the-art descriptors for 3D object recognition from raw point clouds for construction applications such as workspace modeling, asset management and worker tracking. The evaluation was carried out using 3D CAD models with known labels as training data and laser-scanned point clouds from construction sites as testing data. The recognition performance was evaluated with respect to varying level of detail, noise level, degree of occlusion, and computation time. Experimental results show that for all evaluated descriptors, increasing the level of detail and decreasing the noise level results in a moderate increase in recognition accuracy whereas reducing occlusion results in a significant increase in recognition accuracy. In addition, experimental results suggest that the key features that distinguish an object can be derived around the 10 mm level and any further increase in the level of detail do not significantly increase the recognition accuracy. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Elsevier B.V.,,,"Chen J., Fang Y., Cho Y.K.",57191839724;55648722300;55105432400;,"Chen, J., Institute for Robotics and Intelligent Machines, Georgia Institute of Technology, 801 Atlantic Dr. N.W., Atlanta, GA  30332, United States; Fang, Y., Department of Civil Engineering, Monash University, 23 College Walk, VIC, 3800, Australia; Cho, Y.K., School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, 790 Atlantic Dr. N.W., Atlanta, GA  30332-0355, United States",Automation in Construction,Autom Constr,16.0

Graphical visualization of educational information during the studying process of the students in universities,2018,2-s2.0-85058897871,"The article traces the technique of visualization of educational information in various graphic ways. The following methods are best-known by students: the fundamental, traditional cartographic of research and teaching. They learn such methods from the course of the school geography and it is associated with the techniques and knowledge of spatially distributed information on maps and other geoimages. In addition to spatially distributed, there is other information that can be shown graphically. The modern term ""infographics"" is comprehensive in the sense of the grading of any information and denotes various information-graphic works: maps, diagrams, pictograms, figures, icons, logos, etc. Despite the fact that it is most intensively used in design visualization of data, this up-to-date trend, is integrative as a way of presenting and assimilating information including learning one. An integrator provides integrability and polymethodics of its application. An integrator is the graphic representation of a concept or phenomenon (just as there is, for example, literature). Thus, the problematic subject of the article is the creation of the concept of another ""language"" of instruction, a graphic representation of educational information in various ways and methods. Different ways and items of graphical representation of information can be used in a variety of areas of visual communication: from cartographic images and graphic models to the working-out of the visual didactic materials. In such cases the main aim is to cause certain processes of thinking based on images in the students minds. The figure, the graph, the scheme, etc. will be exactly the instrument creating a ""graphical statement"". The training information for university students means mainly ""didactic projection"" of the scientific material and the way of its transformation into an educational one provided by the program. Specially selected scientific materials that are adapted for knowledge as an unknown and its studying allows us to learn the basics of the discipline. Undoubtedly, the researching the issues of educational information visualization during students teaching in universities is necessary and relevant due to it hides great opportunities for increasing the effectiveness of the learning process, the development of creative abilities of students. © 2018, International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference.

Display infrastructure for virtual environments,2018,2-s2.0-85056804376,"Display systems suitable for virtual reality applications can prove useful for a variety of domains. The emergence of low-cost head-mounted displays reinvigorated the area of virtual reality significantly. However, there are still applications where full-scale CAVE-type display systems are better suited. Moreover, the cost of most CAVE-type display systems is typically rather high, thereby making it difficult to justify in a research setting. This article aims at providing a design of less costly display technology combined with inexpensive input devices that implements a virtual environment paradigm suitable for such full-scale visualization and simulation tasks. The focus is on cost-effective display technology that does not break a researchers budget. The software framework utilizing these displays combines different visualization and graphics packages to create an easy-to-use software environment that can run readily on this display. A user study was performed to evaluate the display technology and its usefulness for virtual reality tasks using an accepted measure: presence.

Implementation and evaluation of distributed graph sampling methods with spark,2018,2-s2.0-85053001351,"The growth of graph size has created new problems in graph visualization and graph analysis. To solve the problem, several graph sampling techniques have been proposed dedicated to obtaining a representative subgraph from a complex network. While prior research indicates that sampling on a large-scale graph is not an easy task, especially for topology-based sampling methods (e.g. breadth first sampling). Topology-based sampling methods can produce a more accurate subgraph than node sampling and edge sampling in preserving statistical graph properties. In this paper, we propose three types of distributed sampling algorithms and develop a sampling package on Spark. To evaluate the effectiveness of these distributed sampling techniques, we apply them to three graph datasets and compare them with traditional/non-distributed sampling approaches. The results show that (1) our distributed sampling approaches are as reliable as the non-distributed sampling techniques, and (2) they are a great improvement in sampling efficiency, especially for topology-based sampling. In addition, (3) the distributed architecture of these algorithms causes them to have horizontal scalability. © 2018, Society for Imaging Science and Technology.",Society for Imaging Science and Technology,"Visualization and Data Analysis 2018, VDA 2018",28 January 2018 through 1 February 2018,"Zhang F., Zhang S., Lightsey C.",57195408068;7409373748;57203803137;,"Zhang, F., Mississippi State University, Mississippi State, MS, United States; Zhang, S., Mississippi State University, Mississippi State, MS, United States; Lightsey, C., Mississippi State University, Mississippi State, MS, United States",IS and T International Symposium on Electronic Imaging Science and Technology,IS T Intl.

A comprehensive usability evaluation of an online HR system,2018,2-s2.0-85063149018,"Human resource (HR) systems are now widely recognized as a critical success factor for implementing successful ERP and efficient interaction between employees and their organization. The employees in each organization are considered one of its most valuable resources, and HR systems are considered the backbone of any organization. For an HR system to be efficient, effective, and satisfactory, it is expected to meet various usability criteria. Different usability evaluation methods are available to assess a system’s usability. Employing different usability evaluation methods can offer more reliable and interesting results. MenaMe HR is one of the famous HR systems in the Arabian Gulf region that supports the main features of personnel information management such as payroll information, training, career planning, and appraisal management, among others. This paper aims to comprehensively assess MenaMe’s usability using four usability methods: heuristics evaluation (HE), cognitive walkthrough, competitive research, and automated self-reporting (through user testing). Each of the them contributed to assessing the MenaMe HR system. The assessment results have yielded that system learnability, navigation, presentation, and task support are associated with more usability problems. Understandability and findability have been also linked with a number of usability issues through competitive research and automated self-reporting methods. This research also explores how each method reveals different types of problems. © 2018.",IADIS,"12th International Conference on Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction 2018, 11th International Conference on Game and Entertainment Technologies 2018 and 12th International Conference on Computer Graphics, Visualization, Computer Vision and Image Processing 2018, part of the Multi Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems 2018, MCCSIS 2018",18 July 2018 through 20 July 2018,"Al-Mekhlal M., Abu Romman L., Al-Saqer B.",57207876013;57207881356;57207883290;,"Al-Mekhlal, M., Department of Information Systems, King Faisal University, P.O.

Moran’s Z based adaptive image filter,2018,2-s2.0-85063150696,"A medical image filtering algorithm based on spatial autocorrelation is proposed. The Moran’s Z calculation is used to adapt the average filter. The noisy PET image is reconstructed using MLEM iteration with a low-pass filter applied in image quality improvement post-reconstruction. In practice, a Gaussian filter is often performed for post-filtering. Although this low-pass filter removes the noise in reconstructed PET images, it is associated with significant quantitative information loss. Two phantoms, Huffman and Utah, are used in this work to simulate a Siemens PET scanner using the GATE algorithm. The sinogram was reconstructed using the OSEM algorithm on Matlab. The image noise level with different numbers of iteration were then calculated and filtered using an average filter with or without Moran’s Z adaptation. Image qualities were estimated using PSNR calculation. The PSNR of images using the proposed scheme are higher than those using the non-adaptive average filter.

Sonar image denoising based on wavelet transform using non-local means filtering,2018,2-s2.0-85063161234,"Comparing to optical images, sonar images experience more severe conditions such as degradation, light scattering, low contrast, and blurring. To guarantee the performance of the post processing such as object detection and classification, the need of a proper denoising method for sonar images has claimed. Conventional wavelet transform(WT) domain denoising method may be good candidates but they do not properly work for some cases which have ambiguity in edge and noise separation. Since image blurring after denoising is generally caused by the loss of edge information with low signal-to-noise ratio, the denoising performance may be improved by the introduction of a proper edge decision rule. In this paper, we propose a stationary WT denoising method with edge map and non-local means(NLM) filter for edge decision. Experimental results show that the proposed method has better performance than the three conventional methods(Visushrink, Sureshrink, and Bayesshrink) in terms of the edge preservation and the peak signal-to-noise ratio. © 2018.",IADIS,"12th International Conference on Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction 2018, 11th International Conference on Game and Entertainment Technologies 2018 and 12th International Conference on Computer Graphics, Visualization, Computer Vision and Image Processing 2018, part of the Multi Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems 2018, MCCSIS 2018",18 July 2018 through 20 July 2018,"Lee S.I., Kim W.-J., Yoon K.S.",57207881358;10840414800;35800268600;,"Lee, S.I., Department of Informatics, Gyeongsang National University, 501, Jinju-daero, Jinju-si, Gyeongsangnam-do, 52828, South Korea; Kim, W.-J., Agency for Defense Development, Jinhae PO Box #18, Jinhae-gu, Changwon-si, Gyeongsangnam-do, 51678, South Korea; Yoon, K.S., Department of Aviation Control System, Aviation Campus of Korea Polytechnic, 46 Daehak-gil, Sacheon-si, Gyeongsangnam-do, 52549, South Korea","MCCSIS 2018 - Multi Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems; Proceedings of the International Conferences on Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction 2018, Game and Entertainment Technologies 2018 and Computer Graphics, Visualization, Computer Vision and Image Processing 2018","MCCSIS - Multi Conf.

Thus, a question arises: how to support students in their studies, namely in clarifying doubts, without being necessary to physically be in the higher education institution. As a possible solution to this challenge a collaborative web platform was developed to be used, with mobile devices, to support tutoring at distance. The platform has data transmission capabilities, in real-time, between two users. This paper presents a learning web platform, developed with the purpose to allow doubts clarification, at distance, between teacher and students, in a collaborative way, in real time.

A semi-automated method for measuring Fels indicators for skeletal maturity assessment in children,2018,2-s2.0-85053006174,"The Fels method is a well-known method for assessing the skeletal maturity from hand-wrist X-ray images. This method estimates the skeletal maturity age by manually grading multiple indicators for different hand-wrist bones. Due to the large number of indicators that need to be measured, this is a time-consuming task, especially with large databases of X-ray images. Furthermore, it can be a very subjective task that depends on the observer. Therefore, the need for automation of this process is in high demand. In this study, we have proposed a semi-automatic method to grade a sub-set of Fels indicators. This method is composed of four main steps of pre-processing, ROI extraction, segmentation, and Fels indicator grading. The most challenging step of the algorithm is to segment different bones in the Fels regions of interest (wrist, Finger I, III and V ROIs) which have been done using local Otsu thresholding and active contour filtering. The result of segmentation is evaluated visually on a subset of Fels study data set. © 2018, Society for Imaging Science and Technology.",Society for Imaging Science and Technology,"Visualization and Data Analysis 2018, VDA 2018",28 January 2018 through 1 February 2018,"Gharabaghi S., Wischgoll T.",55246103700;16240506100;,"Gharabaghi, S., Wright State University, Dayton, OH, United States; Wischgoll, T., Wright State University, Dayton, OH, United States",IS and T International Symposium on Electronic Imaging Science and Technology,IS T Intl.

Exploring the impact of ambiguous icons in mobile web interfaces,2018,2-s2.0-85063164365,"Signs and icons are a fundamental part of the user interface (UI). They are mechanisms of interaction between humans and devices (including mobile devices), and they enable users to achieve tasks. Users typically act on icons as a consequence of their understanding of the icon’s visual representation. Meaningful icons enhance users' comprehension, whereas ambiguous icons increase users’ confusion. However, little is known about the confusion that may be caused by ambiguous icons in a sequence of interactions. In other words, there is scarce research regarding the effect of the navigational order or interaction sequence that users undertake on their interpretation of ambiguous icons. Thus, this paper explores the impact of ambiguous icons on the accuracy of users’ interpretations. Ambiguity is controlled by using pairs of visually identical icons with two different meanings. A semiotic analysis was conducted to investigate users' comprehension of the icons and elicit the causes for their interpretations. We also provide insight into the cognitive processes within working memory and the inherent deliberation, reasoning and comprehension processes that influence users’ interpretations. © 2018.",IADIS,"12th International Conference on Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction 2018, 11th International Conference on Game and Entertainment Technologies 2018 and 12th International Conference on Computer Graphics, Visualization, Computer Vision and Image Processing 2018, part of the Multi Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems 2018, MCCSIS 2018",18 July 2018 through 20 July 2018,"AlNuwaiser W., Wilson S., Buchanan G.",57201991612;35427038900;35182392700;,"AlNuwaiser, W., City, University of London, London, United Kingdom; Wilson, S., City, University of London, London, United Kingdom; Buchanan, G., University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia","MCCSIS 2018 - Multi Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems; Proceedings of the International Conferences on Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction 2018, Game and Entertainment Technologies 2018 and Computer Graphics, Visualization, Computer Vision and Image Processing 2018","MCCSIS - Multi Conf.

Recent advancements in facial tracking applications within mobile platforms and cloud computing analytics suggests that new clinical assessment and human computer assessment technologies have significant future potential for pervasive in-clinic and field-based health assessment solutions. This paper reviews the technical capabilities of three facial tracking platforms with a focus on the common issues relating to clinical measurement considerations required for patient-facing systems. Key factors are assessed in relation to 3D camera platforms, mobile applications and cloud computing applications including camera position, lighting and shadows, eye detection and common obstructions or features that affect tracking. Published examples of facial tracking clinical and health wellness applications are presented in relation to human computer interaction interfaces. This paper aims to demonstrate the potential for future applications being developed relating to each of these technologies for clinic-based applications. © 2018.",IADIS,"12th International Conference on Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction 2018, 11th International Conference on Game and Entertainment Technologies 2018 and 12th International Conference on Computer Graphics, Visualization, Computer Vision and Image Processing 2018, part of the Multi Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems 2018, MCCSIS 2018",18 July 2018 through 20 July 2018,"Siena F.L., Byrom B., Watts P., Breedon P.",57189580045;6603466613;57200203048;36705567400;,"Siena, F.L., Nottingham Trent University, 50 Shakespeare Street, Nottingham, NG1 4FQ, United Kingdom; Byrom, B., CRF Health, Brook House - 3rd Floor, 229-243 Shepherds Bush Road, Hammersmith, London, W6 7AN, United Kingdom; Watts, P., Nottingham Trent University, 50 Shakespeare Street, Nottingham, NG1 4FQ, United Kingdom; Breedon, P., Nottingham Trent University, 50 Shakespeare Street, Nottingham, NG1 4FQ, United Kingdom","MCCSIS 2018 - Multi Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems; Proceedings of the International Conferences on Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction 2018, Game and Entertainment Technologies 2018 and Computer Graphics, Visualization, Computer Vision and Image Processing 2018","MCCSIS - Multi Conf.

Modelling user experience: Integrating user experience research into design education,2018,2-s2.0-85063161261,"The last two decades have given a new lease of life to the interpretation of users’ interactions with products in human-computer interaction (HCI) and design domains. As a fast growing field, user experience (UX) brought along multifarious endeavors to frame this new field’s definition and components. In the midst of this burgeoning field, many design related domains started to embrace the terms experience, services, and systems rather than a mere product focus. Academia’s efforts to define what UX really is, influenced the practice by trying to investigate how UX can be put in action. Hence, growing demand from industry created a need for fully trained and specialized UX designers, turning the attention back again to academia. Although one of the most critical components of UX is research to understand users, their interactions, environments, and even the invisible factors; selecting and applying appropriate methods and tools are of high challenge due to concomitant dependence of experiences on subjective perceptions, contextual ties, and timewise conditions. In this light, we have devised a course to be integrated into design education at graduate level with the aim of teaching how to comprehend, interpret, and communicate UX to present input for the design process with a special approach. The particular approach is “modelling UX” because designing for experience and evaluating the success of design output, as well as bethinking scientific improvements and improving the practice, entail investigating experiences with opportune research methods. After delineating background for devising a UX course, this paper dwells on the objectives, content, structure, and outputs of our course; which would be a scaffolding resource for efforts to integrate UX research into design education. © 2018.",IADIS,"12th International Conference on Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction 2018, 11th International Conference on Game and Entertainment Technologies 2018 and 12th International Conference on Computer Graphics, Visualization, Computer Vision and Image Processing 2018, part of the Multi Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems 2018, MCCSIS 2018",18 July 2018 through 20 July 2018,"Yargın G.T., Süner S., Günay A.",56611984300;57192982753;6701907750;,"Yargın, G.T., Middle East Technical University, BILTIR-UTEST Product Usability Unit, Department of Industrial Design, Dumlupinar Bulv.

Probabilistic and bottleneck tandem features for emotion recognition from videos,2018,2-s2.0-85063160971,"This paper proposes a tandem based approach for handcrafted features optimization in facial expression recognition (FER) in the wild. The approach trains an artificial neural network (ANN) to generate new trainable features: probabilistic features and bottleneck features. The former are generated from the class probabilities estimates and the latter are obtained from the activations of a narrow hidden layer in the ANN. In this work, we train a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) on Local Binary Patterns on Three Orthogonal Planes (LBP-TOP) features to extract the so-called probabilistic and bottleneck features. Support Vector Machines (SVM) are used to predict one of the seven emotion categories (anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise and neutral) from the Acted Facial Expression in the Wild (AFEW) database. Noteworthy improvements are shown in the classification accuracy. © 2018.",IADIS,"12th International Conference on Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction 2018, 11th International Conference on Game and Entertainment Technologies 2018 and 12th International Conference on Computer Graphics, Visualization, Computer Vision and Image Processing 2018, part of the Multi Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems 2018, MCCSIS 2018",18 July 2018 through 20 July 2018,"Kasraoui S., Lachiri Z., Madani K.",57207879247;6507731669;7005650228;,"Kasraoui, S., University of Tunis el Manar, LR-SITI Laboratory, National Engineering School of Tunis, BP.37 Le Bélvedère, Tunis, 1002, Tunisia; Lachiri, Z., University of Tunis el Manar, LR-SITI Laboratory, National Engineering School of Tunis, BP.37 Le Bélvedère, Tunis, 1002, Tunisia; Madani, K., Université Paris-Est, University Paris-Est Créteil, LISSI EA-3956 Laboratory, Senart-FB Institute of Technology, 36-37 rue Charpak, Lieusaint, 77127, France","MCCSIS 2018 - Multi Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems; Proceedings of the International Conferences on Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction 2018, Game and Entertainment Technologies 2018 and Computer Graphics, Visualization, Computer Vision and Image Processing 2018","MCCSIS - Multi Conf.

A blind watermarking method for CityGML,2018,2-s2.0-85063159695,"We propose a blind watermarking method for CityGML in this paper. Firstly, we parse the CityGML text file and select the virtual 3D city model for watermarking. Secondly, we transform the model by using geometric invariance. Then, we transform the Cartesian coordinate to the Spherical coordinate to obtain the sphere radii of each vertex. Finally, we insert the watermark by altering the DCT coefficients of the sphere radii segment. We conduct several experiments using different parameters to explore the watermark payload. The method can embed 64 bits watermark into a CityGML model. In addition, it shows good robustness against adding noise, rotation, uniform scaling, translation, and vertices reordering attacks. However, it still has drawbacks under cropping and simplification attacks. © 2018.",IADIS,"12th International Conference on Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction 2018, 11th International Conference on Game and Entertainment Technologies 2018 and 12th International Conference on Computer Graphics, Visualization, Computer Vision and Image Processing 2018, part of the Multi Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems 2018, MCCSIS 2018",18 July 2018 through 20 July 2018,"Jiang D., Kim J.",56026324200;7601378527;,"Jiang, D., Dept. of Copyright Protection, Sangmyung University, Seoul, South Korea; Kim, J., Dept. of Electronics Engineering, Sangmyung University, Seoul, South Korea","MCCSIS 2018 - Multi Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems; Proceedings of the International Conferences on Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction 2018, Game and Entertainment Technologies 2018 and Computer Graphics, Visualization, Computer Vision and Image Processing 2018","MCCSIS - Multi Conf.

BlueEyes – Easing the navigation and orientation of blind people,2018,2-s2.0-85063158706,"As reported by the World Health Organization (WHO), of the 7 billion people alive today, an estimated 253 million live with visual impairment that cannot be corrected with glasses or contact lenses. From these, 30 million blind or partially sighted persons live in Europe. Over the past years, blindness that is caused by diseases has decreased due to the success of public health actions. However, the number of blind people that are over 60 years old is increasing by 2 million per decade. Unfortunately, all these numbers are estimated to be doubled by 2020. With these facts, is necessary to bring awareness and understanding of the challenges blind people face and help to motivate research into new technology to answer those questions. This document starts to identify the challenges people with visual disabilities face in their life. The problem of navigation and orientation as well the different possibilities to deal with the locomotion situation is also addressed in this paper. It describes the traditional navigational solutions as well other which involves more sophisticated technological devices and their multimodal interfaces.

Local ternary descriptor for 3D model matching and retrieval,2018,2-s2.0-85063158646,"Qmodel Creator is a software for designing block (LEGO) style 3D models using intuitive drawing methods. The produced models are composed of cubes, which are conveniently encoded using voxel-based representation. To support content-based search and retrieval for models generated with Qmodel Creator, we proposed a feature descriptor defined as 3D local ternary descriptor (3DLTD) in this paper. To begin with, we partition the bounding box of each model into cubes and then divide cubes into voxels. Weights are assigned to each voxel according to its distance to the boundary. We randomly select 64 pairs of voxels in each cube and generate a ternary code based on the relationship between each pair of voxels. Weighted bipartite matching is employed to compute the similarity between two models. Experimental results indicate that 3DLTD is suitable for comparing and searching voxel-based 3D models. Compared with 3DBRIEF, our proposed framework is more robust and efficient thanks to the two-level partition. Ternary encoding also promotes feature representativeness and noise immunity while maintaining overall efficacy. © 2018.",IADIS,"12th International Conference on Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction 2018, 11th International Conference on Game and Entertainment Technologies 2018 and 12th International Conference on Computer Graphics, Visualization, Computer Vision and Image Processing 2018, part of the Multi Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems 2018, MCCSIS 2018",18 July 2018 through 20 July 2018,"Liao W.-H., Wang C.-M., Wu Y.-C.",7203057074;57207882144;56582896300;,"Liao, W.-H., Dept. of Computer Science, National Chengchi University, Taipei, Taiwan; Wang, C.-M., Dept. of Computer Science, National Chengchi University, Taipei, Taiwan; Wu, Y.-C., Dept. of Computer Science, National Chengchi University, Taipei, Taiwan","MCCSIS 2018 - Multi Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems; Proceedings of the International Conferences on Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction 2018, Game and Entertainment Technologies 2018 and Computer Graphics, Visualization, Computer Vision and Image Processing 2018","MCCSIS - Multi Conf.

An experimental study to evaluate influence of usability on learning behaviour,2018,2-s2.0-85063148321,"Usability has been one of the well-established quality measures of HCI systems. Designing an efficient e-learning system is a complex process and requires usability testing at various stages. Unlike conventional HCI systems, e-learning system is not only designed to interact with users but also to facilitate learning to user. In order to develop learner centric system design, there is a need to find the ways in which learning and usability interact. In this study, six learning behaviour markers were identified which can be integrated with conventional usability testing. This paper investigates a relationship between usability attributes and learning behaviour through usability testing of two different e-learning websites with similar in content but different in usability. Other than usability attributes and learning behaviour markers, Galvanic skin response (GSR) of users was also recorded and compared to support the usability testing results. Significant difference (p<0.05) was found in learning behaviour marker counts and GSR along with functional usability testing attributes of both websites. © 2018.",IADIS,"12th International Conference on Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction 2018, 11th International Conference on Game and Entertainment Technologies 2018 and 12th International Conference on Computer Graphics, Visualization, Computer Vision and Image Processing 2018, part of the Multi Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems 2018, MCCSIS 2018",18 July 2018 through 20 July 2018,"Kumar J., Khare A.P., Kumar J.",57200590020;57207875164;8062428200;,"Kumar, J., Indian Institute of technology Delhi, New Delhi, India; Khare, A.P., Indian Institute of technology Delhi, New Delhi, India; Kumar, J., Indian Institute of technology Delhi, New Delhi, India","MCCSIS 2018 - Multi Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems; Proceedings of the International Conferences on Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction 2018, Game and Entertainment Technologies 2018 and Computer Graphics, Visualization, Computer Vision and Image Processing 2018","MCCSIS - Multi Conf.

"Exploring aesthetics, emotion and usability in eLearning applications for users with intellectual disability",2018,2-s2.0-85063147567,"Despite the abundance of literature in the area of human-computer interaction (HCI), there is limited HCI research about users with intellectual disability. This research project evaluates Let's Be Safe, an eLearning application in development at the Institute of Art, Design and Technology, Dun Laoghaire. This application aims to educate young adults with intellectual disability about cyberbullying - an issue prevalent among this population - and cybersafety. Twenty-two individuals with mild to moderate intellectual disability took part in the research. The study employed a mixed-methods design including observational and inquiry methods of usability evaluation. The evaluation investigated the relationships between perceived aesthetics, emotional response and usability for the application. The analyses found no significant relationships between aesthetics, emotional response and usability for this user group. However, the research gathered rich data, which will contribute to the development of Let's Be Safe. © 2018.",IADIS,"12th International Conference on Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction 2018, 11th International Conference on Game and Entertainment Technologies 2018 and 12th International Conference on Computer Graphics, Visualization, Computer Vision and Image Processing 2018, part of the Multi Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems 2018, MCCSIS 2018",18 July 2018 through 20 July 2018,"O' Sheehan H., McDonnell M., Connolly I.",57207877605;57200193819;11041590100;,"O' Sheehan, H., Institute of Art, Design and Technology, Kill Avenue, Dun Laoghaire, Co.

Reconstruction of geometrically processed surface from computed tomography data,2018,2-s2.0-85063146512,"Within this work we consider a problem of isosurface polygonizing by it`s reconstruction from scalar field, obtained from computed tomography data. Proposed method allows to get polygonal surface, convenient for further geometric processing. Firstly, for the problem solving, we build a minimal (this allows to reduce ambiguities) graph, nodes of which represent target surface`s vertices. Secondly, we triangulate the graph by it`s faces traversal. Thirdly, during geometric postprocessing we process the graph in order to improve the surface quality (resolving ambiguities, surface smoothing, holes triangulation). Declared problem can also be solved by Marching Cubes algorithm. However, our approach allows to obtain surface of higher quality and less time spent. Similarly to Marching Cubes algorithm, in our approach we test a condition that is aimed to check for presence of the surface between two nodes with known scalar field values. In our heart CT-scans experiments we examined various forms of our conditions and reconstructed more surfaces than we did using classical Marching Cubes implementation. In addition, our method is fully automatic and doesn`t demand usage of supercomputers, but runs normally on desktop computers. Finally, our method is parallelized at all stages and possesses linear acceleration, relative to the number of processors, that is confirmed by theoretical estimates and experiments. © 2018.",IADIS,"12th International Conference on Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction 2018, 11th International Conference on Game and Entertainment Technologies 2018 and 12th International Conference on Computer Graphics, Visualization, Computer Vision and Image Processing 2018, part of the Multi Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems 2018, MCCSIS 2018",18 July 2018 through 20 July 2018,"Novozhilov M., Dubrovskaya M.",57190227710;57207880732;,"Novozhilov, M., Lobachevsky State University of Nizhni Novgorod, Russian Federation, 23 Prospekt Gagarina (Gagarin Avenue, Nizhni Novgorod, Russian Federation; Dubrovskaya, M., Lobachevsky State University of Nizhni Novgorod, Russian Federation, 23 Prospekt Gagarina (Gagarin Avenue, Nizhni Novgorod, Russian Federation","MCCSIS 2018 - Multi Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems; Proceedings of the International Conferences on Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction 2018, Game and Entertainment Technologies 2018 and Computer Graphics, Visualization, Computer Vision and Image Processing 2018","MCCSIS - Multi Conf.

Mechanical performance assessment system for endotracheal tube introducers using motion detection and object tracking,2018,2-s2.0-85063146240,"Failure to secure the airway with an endotracheal tube in a timely manner on induction of anaesthesia can lead to serious complications, including death. Equipment design and selection can often contribute to procedure success or failure, although current equipment does not always provide optimum solutions. Most anaesthetists consider endotracheal tube introducers (bougies) essential equipment; however, there are many different types available, with little relative performance data to inform choice. To date, no performance assessment system exists that is capable of assessing the shape retention properties of bougies.

Extraction method of keypoint descriptor for object recognition in sonar image,2018,2-s2.0-85063146118,"In sonar images, the object shape is often distorted by the external conditions such as sedimentation, pulse repetition interval, ship speed, and redirection, which is generally modeled as the affine transform. Scale invariant feature transform(SIFT) and pyramid-SIFT(p-SIFT) are known as a good solution to the scale and rotation variance. However, these methods are vulnerable to the shearing problem. To solve the affine problem in sonar imaging systems, we propose a new keypoint descriptor extraction method. The proposed method generates multiple keypoint descriptors based on affine transformed images, and picks out effective keypoint descriptors. Test results show that the proposed method, in terms of recognition rate, has better accuracy than those of the conventional methods for scaling of x, y-axis, rotation, and shearing cases. The average improved accuracy rate of SIFT and p-SIFT is 7% and 4%, respectively. © 2018.",IADIS,"12th International Conference on Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction 2018, 11th International Conference on Game and Entertainment Technologies 2018 and 12th International Conference on Computer Graphics, Visualization, Computer Vision and Image Processing 2018, part of the Multi Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems 2018, MCCSIS 2018",18 July 2018 through 20 July 2018,"Park J.M., Kim W.-J., Yoon K.S.",57207884259;10840414800;35800268600;,"Park, J.M., Department of Informatics, Gyeongsang National University, 501, Jinju-daero, Jinju-si, Gyeongsangnam-do, 52828, South Korea; Kim, W.-J., Agency for Defense Development, Jinhae PO Box #18, Jinhae-gu, Changwon-si, Gyeongsangnam-do, 51678, South Korea; Yoon, K.S., Department of Aviation Control System, Aviation Campus of Korea Polytechnic, 46 Daehak-gil, Sacheon-si, Gyeongsangnam-do, 52549, South Korea","MCCSIS 2018 - Multi Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems; Proceedings of the International Conferences on Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction 2018, Game and Entertainment Technologies 2018 and Computer Graphics, Visualization, Computer Vision and Image Processing 2018","MCCSIS - Multi Conf.

We build upon the assumptions of the social identity approach to explain purchases of virtual items. Additionally, we investigate individual and cultural antecedents of social identification. Results of our survey (n=181) indicate that social identification holds the potential to explain the intention to purchase virtual items and that cultural (patriotism) as well as individual (psychosocial development) factors predict social identification. © 2018.",IADIS,"12th International Conference on Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction 2018, 11th International Conference on Game and Entertainment Technologies 2018 and 12th International Conference on Computer Graphics, Visualization, Computer Vision and Image Processing 2018, part of the Multi Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems 2018, MCCSIS 2018",18 July 2018 through 20 July 2018,"Kordyaka B., Jahn K., Niehaves B.",57197778968;57193132674;12139031400;,"Kordyaka, B., University of Siegen, Kohlbettstraße 15, Siegen, 57072, Germany; Jahn, K., University of Siegen, Kohlbettstraße 15, Siegen, 57072, Germany; Niehaves, B., University of Siegen, Kohlbettstraße 15, Siegen, 57072, Germany","MCCSIS 2018 - Multi Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems; Proceedings of the International Conferences on Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction 2018, Game and Entertainment Technologies 2018 and Computer Graphics, Visualization, Computer Vision and Image Processing 2018","MCCSIS - Multi Conf.

Predictors of gaze agency in gaze-controlled interfaces,2018,2-s2.0-85063135884,"Gaze-controlled interaction is gradually becoming a viable alternative to conventional input modalities beyond the realm of assistive technology. However, very little is known about what makes people experience control over gaze-contingent change in the interface and what makes gaze-controlled interaction feel natural. The sense of control over gaze-contingent interface change is referred to as gaze agency. The experiment presented in this paper explores 1) whether delay between the gaze action onset and display change (i.e. continuous dwell) predicts gaze agency, and 2) whether experience of gaze agency changes depending on whether participants consciously perceive the delay between the gaze action onset and display change or not. Results show that continuous dwell is a significant predictor of gaze agency and that participants experience greater agency when they are not conscious of the delay between the gaze action onset and its causal outcome as opposed to when they perceive the delay or have doubts whether there was a delay. © 2018.",IADIS,"12th International Conference on Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction 2018, 11th International Conference on Game and Entertainment Technologies 2018 and 12th International Conference on Computer Graphics, Visualization, Computer Vision and Image Processing 2018, part of the Multi Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems 2018, MCCSIS 2018",18 July 2018 through 20 July 2018,Slobodenyuk N.,55850759200;,"Slobodenyuk, N., Carleton University, Institute of Cognitive Science, 2201 Dunton Tower, 1125 Colonel by Drive, Ottawa, ON  K1S 5B6, Canada","MCCSIS 2018 - Multi Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems; Proceedings of the International Conferences on Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction 2018, Game and Entertainment Technologies 2018 and Computer Graphics, Visualization, Computer Vision and Image Processing 2018","MCCSIS - Multi Conf.

Instant church: A data-driven eucharist realized as a Christian performance slot machine,2018,2-s2.0-85063135828,"Falling attention and acceptance of the church in society, resignations and falling memberships, lack of use of digital technology and interactive media in this context needs to be investigated and new approaches should be tested. In this Paper our contribution transfers the eucharist celebration into a data-driven slot machine using a Design Based Research methodology. The sensor and microcontroller-based artifact uses real time social media data analytics to start actuators and a laser engraving process, triggered by a coin slot of the user. With that interactive machine the religious service is translated into a design fiction and tested for its acceptance in a public exhibition with around 700 visitors. In doing so, we examined the question of whether religious processes can be automated and whether social media can be used in conjunction with a digital artifact in order to generate an intensive dispute about religion. The qualitative evaluation shows that almost all younger users reflected positively about the interactive exhibit while some of the 40+ religious people showed strong negative emotions.

Design and evaluation of smartphone-based training for mindfulness and openness to experience,2018,2-s2.0-85063134194,"In this study a modified version of an app for training mindfulness and the mindfulness factor openness to experience, is presented. This study also extends the utility of an existing app, Positive Activity Jackpot. The Positive Activity Jackpot app uses gamified micro-tasks, by developing and integrating mindfulness-specific tasks. An evaluation of the app’s subjective and objective efficacy is reported from the findings in the following two studies: firstly, an expert review and secondly, a between subjects experiment. The newly created/modified app was rated by experts as a suitable tool for inducing the state mindfulness in the first study and demonstrated a significant training effect for state mindfulness in the second study, but failed to reach significance for the openness to experience measure. In conclusion, micro-tasks using mindfulness apps may fit current busy schedules, as well as engaging users through playful audio-visual feedback. The validity of the openness to experience sub-scale in this study, as well as the lack of appropriate state mindfulness instruments for evaluating digital mindfulness apps, were identified as main limitations. © 2018.",IADIS,"12th International Conference on Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction 2018, 11th International Conference on Game and Entertainment Technologies 2018 and 12th International Conference on Computer Graphics, Visualization, Computer Vision and Image Processing 2018, part of the Multi Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems 2018, MCCSIS 2018",18 July 2018 through 20 July 2018,"Sliwinski J., Katsikitis M., Jones C.M.",56940448300;6601912338;23397482900;,"Sliwinski, J., University of the Sunshine Coast, Queensland, Australia; Katsikitis, M., University of the Sunshine Coast, Queensland, Australia; Jones, C.M., University of the Sunshine Coast, Queensland, Australia","MCCSIS 2018 - Multi Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems; Proceedings of the International Conferences on Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction 2018, Game and Entertainment Technologies 2018 and Computer Graphics, Visualization, Computer Vision and Image Processing 2018","MCCSIS - Multi Conf.

Gamer typology based on personality and motivational footprints,2018,2-s2.0-85063131415,"This proposed contribution discusses to what extent the choice of particular video games mirrors a player’s personality with gaming motivations as an intermediate variable. Based on an online survey (n=1612) we first confirm the applicability of the five-factor (OCEAN) model on personality types in a German speaking gamers’ context. Gaming motivation is then introduced as a psychological concept contrasting motives and incentives. A recent empirical study by Yee on gaming motivations with a US perspective is generally replicated with our sample. Motivations are analogously derived from a principal component analysis of over 40 items referring to diverse aspects of gaming motivations. A cluster analysis suggests clusters of motivations that could in turn be correlated with specific personality aspects. Furthermore, with certain “motivational footprints” and “gamer personalities” respectively certain games are favoured. Knowing particularly enticing combinations of motivations met may guide the development of future games targeting specific personalities. © 2018.",IADIS,"12th International Conference on Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction 2018, 11th International Conference on Game and Entertainment Technologies 2018 and 12th International Conference on Computer Graphics, Visualization, Computer Vision and Image Processing 2018, part of the Multi Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems 2018, MCCSIS 2018",18 July 2018 through 20 July 2018,"Kolo C., Lüst N.",6603827463;57207878888;,"Kolo, C., Macromedia University of Applied Sciences, Sandstraße 9, Munich, 80335, Germany; Lüst, N., Macromedia University of Applied Sciences, Sandstraße 9, Munich, 80335, Germany","MCCSIS 2018 - Multi Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems; Proceedings of the International Conferences on Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction 2018, Game and Entertainment Technologies 2018 and Computer Graphics, Visualization, Computer Vision and Image Processing 2018","MCCSIS - Multi Conf.

Patient-maintained propofol sedation: The anaesthetists’ point of view,2018,2-s2.0-85063131292,"Many operations within the UK do not require general anaesthesia, and are instead carried out under sedation. A doctor normally provides this, and as the patient is not in control, they may be either under or over-sedated due to a misjudgement of patient anxiety. One solution would be to allow the patients to directly control their own sedation level. This paper presents an invention for innovation (i4i) project developing such a Patient Maintained Propofol Sedation Device (PMPSD). Due to the health risks associated with under and over-sedation, the anaesthetists’ interface takes on an added importance to ensure they can oversee the process and intervene when needed. Through the project, a unique opportunity has arisen where anaesthetists have been involved throughout the interface design process, contributing to the development and testing of a prototype. We present this prototype, highlight its key features and how it differs from existing sedation pump interface systems.

Google glass as a learning tool: Sharing evaluation results for the role of optical head mounted displays in education,2018,2-s2.0-85063130390,This paper provides an overview of the findings from an evaluation of the role of Google Glass in education over the past three years. The authors have experimented with Optical Head Mounted Displays as a support tool for various learning activities over the past few years. The study described in the paper commenced back in 2014 and continued despite the fact that the development of the Google Glass technology was paused and then shifted towards enterprise clientele. This was a result of our confidence that the future of learning interfaces is aligned to the proliferation of augmented reality and the fact that the Google Glass interface offers an ideal tool for learners due to its light structure and seamless wearing experience. The paper discusses how Google Glass has been used for a range of learning activities and describes the learners’ experiences from using the device. The main contribution of the paper is in the form of measuring the success of the specific interface by sharing the results of three years of evaluations. The evaluation results are further analysed taking under consideration a number of profiling techniques of the learners involved including their personality type and learning style. © 2018.,IADIS,"12th International Conference on Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction 2018, 11th International Conference on Game and Entertainment Technologies 2018 and 12th International Conference on Computer Graphics, Visualization, Computer Vision and Image Processing 2018, part of the Multi Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems 2018, MCCSIS 2018",18 July 2018 through 20 July 2018,"Dafoulas G., Maia C.C., Tsiakara A.",57215572330;55934157700;57207875820;,"Dafoulas, G., Computer Science Department, Faculty of Science and Technology, Middlesex University, Burroughs, Hendon, London, NW4 4BT, United Kingdom; Maia, C.C., Computer Science Department, Faculty of Science and Technology, Middlesex University, Burroughs, Hendon, London, NW4 4BT, United Kingdom; Tsiakara, A., Computer Science Department, Faculty of Science and Technology, Middlesex University, Burroughs, Hendon, London, NW4 4BT, United Kingdom","MCCSIS 2018 - Multi Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems; Proceedings of the International Conferences on Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction 2018, Game and Entertainment Technologies 2018 and Computer Graphics, Visualization, Computer Vision and Image Processing 2018","MCCSIS - Multi Conf.

Artifact removal and lesion segmentation for melanoma detection in skin lesion images,2018,2-s2.0-85063129233,"Melanoma is a severe form of skin cancer characterized by the rapid multiplication of pigment-producing cells. There are new techniques for automated analysis of skin lesions for classification of melanoma using images from digital cameras and smart phones. A problem on analysis of these images are interesting because of the existence of artifacts and noise such as hair, veins, water residue, illuminations and light reflections. An important step in the diagnosis of melanoma is the removal of artifacts and reduction of noise that can inhibit the examination to accurately segment the skin lesion from the surrounding skin area. In this paper, a new method for extraction of skin lesion is implemented based on image enhancement and morphological operators. The experimental results show that artifact removal and lesion segmentation in skin lesion images can perform a true detection rate of 95.37% for melanoma skin lesion segmentation. © 2018.",IADIS,"12th International Conference on Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction 2018, 11th International Conference on Game and Entertainment Technologies 2018 and 12th International Conference on Computer Graphics, Visualization, Computer Vision and Image Processing 2018, part of the Multi Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems 2018, MCCSIS 2018",18 July 2018 through 20 July 2018,"Salido J.A., Ruiz C., Jr., Marcos N.",57195107309;57200076488;6602859494;,"Salido, J.A., College of Computer Studies, De La Salle University, Manila, Philippines; Ruiz, C., Jr., College of Computer Studies, De La Salle University, Manila, Philippines; Marcos, N., College of Computer Studies, De La Salle University, Manila, Philippines","MCCSIS 2018 - Multi Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems; Proceedings of the International Conferences on Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction 2018, Game and Entertainment Technologies 2018 and Computer Graphics, Visualization, Computer Vision and Image Processing 2018","MCCSIS - Multi Conf.

Usability evaluation of a web-based tool for supporting holistic building energy management,2017,2-s2.0-85028979335,"This paper presents the evaluation of the level of usability of an intelligent monitoring and control interface for energy efficient management of public buildings, called BuildVis, which forms part of a Building Energy Management System (BEMS.) The BEMS ‘intelligence’ is derived from an intelligent algorithm component which brings together ANN-GA rule generation, a fuzzy rule selection engine, and a semantic knowledge base. The knowledge base makes use of linked data and an integrated ontology to uplift heterogeneous data sources relevant to building energy consumption. The developed ontology is based upon the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), which is a Building Information Modelling (BIM) standard and consists of two different types of rule model to control and manage the buildings adaptively. The populated rules are a mix of an intelligent rule generation approach using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Genetic Algorithms (GA), and also data mining rules using Decision Tree techniques on historical data. The resulting rules are triggered by the intelligent controller, which processes available sensor measurements in the building. This generates ‘suggestions’ which are presented to the Facility Manager (FM) on the BuildVis web-based interface. BuildVis uses HTML5 innovations to visualise a 3D interactive model of the building that is accessible over a wide range of desktop and mobile platforms. The suggestions are presented on a zone by zone basis, alerting them to potential energy saving actions. As the usability of the system is seen as a key determinate to success, the paper evaluates the level of usability for both a set of technical users and also the FMs for five European buildings, providing analysis and lessons learned from the approach taken. © 2017",Elsevier B.V.,,,"McGlinn K., Yuce B., Wicaksono H., Howell S., Rezgui Y.",22938154900;14027607600;36447071900;56367541100;6701829347;,"McGlinn, K., ADAPT Centre, The Knowledge and Data Engineering Group, School of Computer Science and Statistics, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland; Yuce, B., College of Engineering, Mathematics and Physical Sciences, University of Exeter, Streatham Campus, Exeter, EX4 4QJ, United Kingdom, BRE Institute of Sustainable Engineering, School of Engineering, Cardiff University, Queen's Buildings, The Parade, Cardiff, CF24 3AA, United Kingdom; Wicaksono, H., Institute for Information Management in Engineering, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany, Department of Management, Airlangga University, Surabaya, Indonesia; Howell, S., BRE Institute of Sustainable Engineering, School of Engineering, Cardiff University, Queen's Buildings, The Parade, Cardiff, CF24 3AA, United Kingdom; Rezgui, Y., BRE Institute of Sustainable Engineering, School of Engineering, Cardiff University, Queen's Buildings, The Parade, Cardiff, CF24 3AA, United Kingdom",Automation in Construction,Autom Constr,23.0

"TSViz: A data stream architecture to online collect, analyze, and visualize tweets",2017,2-s2.0-85020904471,"The huge amount of data daily produced through social networks, such as Twitter, has been motivating several researchers and companies to design approaches to model and study users' behavior/feelings. Most of the current studies have been focusing on building tweet datasets which are later analyzed using offline tools. This paper introduces a new approach through the development of the TSViz tool which online collects and analyzes tweets seen as data streams (in an online and incremental fashion). Given a hashtag, TSViz online gathers all tweets associated to it and organizes a multidimensional data stream, which can be seen as a time series. TSViz has three main components: i) a Robot responsible for the online collection of tweets according to the selected hashtags (defined by users); ii) an analysis component which employs Statistics, Dynamical Systems and Machine Learning methods to extract information and patterns from data; iii) a Web visualization tool to support users' interpretation of results. In the context of this paper, we present results on hashtags associated with the Brazil's political crisis in an attempt to understand the impacts of the public opinion and their relationships to the impeachment of its president. Our analysis confirms the daily volume of tweets and the amount of new information suffered a significant impact along time due to specific events associated with the impeachment process. © 2017 ACM.",Association for Computing Machinery,"32nd Annual ACM Symposium on Applied Computing, SAC 2017",4 April 2017 through 6 April 2017,"Rios R.A., Pagliosa P.A., Ishii R.P., De Mello R.F.",36806799800;24451204700;55001410600;35405503200;,"Rios, R.A., UFBA, BA, Brazil; Pagliosa, P.A., UFMS, MS, Brazil; Ishii, R.P., UFMS, MS, Brazil; De Mello, R.F., USP, SP, Brazil",Proceedings of the ACM Symposium on Applied Computing,Proc ACM Symp Appl Computing,4.0

VizScribe allows designers to create, customize, and extend interactive visualizations for design protocol data such as video, transcripts, sketches, sensor data, and user logs. User studies where design researchers used VizScribe for protocol analysis indicated that the linked views and interactive navigation offered by VizScribe afforded the researchers multiple, useful ways to approach and interpret such multimodal data. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Academic Press,,,"Chandrasegaran S., Badam S.K., Kisselburgh L., Peppler K., Elmqvist N., Ramani K.",55441484400;55939203400;6504705059;23005878600;6506645565;7006683312;,"Chandrasegaran, S., College of Information Studies, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, United States; Badam, S.K., Department of Computer Science, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, United States; Kisselburgh, L., The Center for Education and Research, Information Assurance and Security, The Burton Morgan Center for Entrepreneurship, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, United States; Peppler, K., School of Education, Indiana University, Bloomington, IN, United States; Elmqvist, N., College of Information Studies, Department of Computer Science, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, United States; Ramani, K., School of Mechanical Engineering, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering (by courtesy), Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, United States",International Journal of Human Computer Studies,Int J Hum Comput Stud,7.0
Discriminant component analysis for privacy protection and visualization of big data,2017,2-s2.0-84944710346,"Big data has many divergent types of sources, from physical (sensor/IoT) to social and cyber (web) types, rendering it messy and, imprecise, and incomplete. Due to its quantitative (volume and velocity) and qualitative (variety) challenges, big data to the users resembles something like “the elephant to the blind men”. It is imperative to enact a major paradigm shift in data mining and learning tools so that information from diversified sources must be integrated together to unravel information hidden in the massive and messy big data, so that, metaphorically speaking, it would let the blind men “see” the elephant. This talk will address yet another vital “V”-paradigm: “Visualization”. Visualization tools are meant to supplement (instead of replace) the domain expertise (e.g. a cardiologist) and provide a big picture to help users formulate critical questions and subsequently postulate heuristic and insightful answers. For big data, the curse of high feature dimensionality is causing grave concerns on computational complexity and over-training. In this talk, we shall explore various projection methods for dimension reduction - a prelude to visualization of vectorial and non-vectorial data. A popular visualization tool for unsupervised learning is Principal Component Analysis (PCA). PCA aims at the best recoverability of the original data in the Euclidean Vector Space (EVS). However, PCA is not effective for supervised and collaborative learning environment. Discriminant Component Analysis (DCA), basically a supervised PCA, can be derived via a notion of Canonical Vector Space (CVS). The signal subspace components of DCA are associated with the discriminant distance/power (related to the classification effectiveness) while the noise subspace components of DCA are tightly coupled with the recoverability and/or privacy protection. DCA enjoys two major merits: First, because the rank of the signal subspace is limited by the number of classes, DCA can effectively support classification using a relatively small dimensionality (i.e. high compression). Second, in DCA, the eigenvalues of the noise-space are ordered according to their corresponding reconstruction errors and can thus be used to control recoverability or anti-recoverability by applying respectively an negative or positive ridge. Via DCA, individual data can be highly compressed before being uploaded to the cloud, and thus better enabling privacy protection. In many practical scenarios, additional privacy protection can be incorporated by allowing individual participants to selectively hide some personal features. The classification of masked data calls for a kernel approach to Incomplete Data Analysis (KAIDA). More specifically, we extend PCA/DCA to their kernel variants. The success of kernel machines hinges upon the kernel function adopted to characterize the similarity of pairs of partially-specified vectors. Simulations on the HAR dataset confirm that DCA far outperforms PCA, both in their conventional or kernelized variants. For the latter, the visualization/classification results suggest favorable performance by the proposed partial correlation kernels over the imputed RBF kernel. In addition, the visualization results further points to a potentially promising approach via multiple kernels such as combining an imputed Gaussian RBF kernel and a non-imputed partial correlation kernel. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Springer New York LLC,,,Kung S.-Y.,7102989364;,"Kung, S.-Y., Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ  08544, United States",Multimedia Tools and Applications,Multimedia Tools Appl,10.0
CompanionViz: Mediated platform for gauging canine health and enhancing human–pet interactions,2017,2-s2.0-84977671240,"Advancements in personal data collection and visualization – commonly referred to as the quantified self (QS) movement – allow individuals to self-track health and other attributes. We extend quantified self (QS) concepts to the quantified other (QO) to explore how the use of technology, collection of data on one's pet dog, and personal visualization affect pet owners' understandings of, and relationships with, their pets. We introduce the term Human–pet–computer interaction (HPCI) as the study of how technology can be designed and used to advance human–pet companionships. As an example, we describe CompanionViz, a personal information visualization prototype designed to inform pet owners on their dogs’ caloric inputs/outputs, as well as exercise and movement habits. We present a user study of CompanionViz featuring a twelve-participant survey and one field study, consisting of three unique use cases, and show that by providing pet owners with quantifiable awareness of their dogs’ health and exercise habits using personal visual representations, pet owner–dog bonds can benefit. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Academic Press,,,"Nelson J.K., Shih P.C.",56921079700;35782543700;,"Nelson, J.K., GeoVISTA Center, Department of Geography, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA  16802, United States; Shih, P.C., School of Informatics and Computing, Indiana University, Bloomington, IN  47405, United States",International Journal of Human Computer Studies,Int J Hum Comput Stud,10.0
"Evaluating the effect of visually represented geodata uncertainty on decision-making: systematic review, lessons learned, and recommendations",2017,2-s2.0-84941686201,"For many years, uncertainty visualization has been a topic of research in several disparate fields, particularly in geographical visualization (geovisualization), information visualization, and scientific visualization. Multiple techniques have been proposed and implemented to visually depict uncertainty, but their evaluation has received less attention by the research community. In order to understand how uncertainty visualization influences reasoning and decision-making using spatial information in visual displays, this paper presents a comprehensive review of uncertainty visualization assessments from geovisualization and related fields. We systematically analyze characteristics of the studies under review, i.e., number of participants, tasks, evaluation metrics, etc. An extensive summary of findings with respect to the effects measured or the impact of different visualization techniques helps to identify commonalities and differences in the outcome. Based on this summary, we derive “lessons learned” and provide recommendations for carrying out evaluation of uncertainty visualizations. As a basis for systematic evaluation, we present a categorization of research foci related to evaluating the effects of uncertainty visualization on decision-making. By assigning the studies to categories, we identify gaps in the literature and suggest key research questions for the future. This paper is the second of two reviews on uncertainty visualization. It follows the first that covers the communication of uncertainty, to investigate the effects of uncertainty visualization on reasoning and decision-making. © 2015 Cartography and Geographic Information Society.",Taylor and Francis Inc.,,,"Kinkeldey C., MacEachren A.M., Riveiro M., Schiewe J.",35208441300;7004102300;23036406500;6701466621;,"Kinkeldey, C., Lab for Geoinformatics and Geovisualization (g2lab), HafenCity University Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany; MacEachren, A.M., GeoVISTA Center and Department of Geography, Penn State University, University Park, PA, United States; Riveiro, M., Informatics Research Centre, University of Skövde, Skövde, Sweden; Schiewe, J., Lab for Geoinformatics and Geovisualization (g2lab), HafenCity University Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany",Cartography and Geographic Information Science,Cartogr.

Evaluating data stability in aggregation structures across spatial scales: revisiting the modifiable areal unit problem,2017,2-s2.0-84945217180,"Socioeconomic and health analysts commonly rely on areally aggregated data, in part because government regulations on confidentiality prohibit data release at the individual level. Analytical results from areally aggregated data, however, are sensitive to the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP). Levels of aggregation as well as the arbitrary and modifiable sizes, shapes, and arrangements of zones affect the validity and reliability of findings from analyses of areally aggregated data. MAUP, long acknowledged, remains unresolved. We present an exploratory spatial data analytical approach (ESDA) to understand the scalar effects of MAUP. To characterize relationships between data aggregation structures and spatial scales, we develop a method for statistically and visually exploring the local indicators of spatial association (LISA) exhibited between a variable and itself across varying levels of aggregation. We demonstrate our approach by analyzing the across-scale relationships of aggregated 2010 median income for the State of Pennsylvania and 2005–2009 cancer diagnosis rates for the State of New York between county–tract, tract–block group, and county–block group level US census designated enumeration units. This method for understanding the relationship between MAUP and spatial scale provides guidance to researchers in selecting the most appropriate scales to aggregate, analyze, and represent data for problem-specific analyses. © 2015 Cartography and Geographic Information Society.",Taylor and Francis Inc.,,,"Nelson J.K., Brewer C.A.",56921079700;7202841490;,"Nelson, J.K., Department of Geography, Pennsylvania State University, State College, PA, United States; Brewer, C.A., Department of Geography, Pennsylvania State University, State College, PA, United States",Cartography and Geographic Information Science,Cartogr.

Effectiveness of feature-driven storytelling in 3D time-varying data visualization,2017,2-s2.0-85041514180,"Storytelling animation has a great potential to be widely adopted by domain scientists for exploring trends in scientific simulations. However, due to the dynamic nature and generation methods of animations, serious concerns have been raised regarding their effectiveness for analytical tasks. This has led to interactive techniques often being favored over animations, as they provide the user with complete control over the visualization. This trend in scientific visualization design has not yet considered newer algorithmic animation generation methods that are driven by the automatic analysis of data features and storytelling techniques. In this work, the authors performed an experiment which compares feature-driven storytelling animations to common interactive visualization techniques for time-varying scientific simulations. They discuss the design of the experiment, including tasks for storm-surge analysis that are representative of common scientific visualization projects. Their results illustrate the relative advantages of both feature-driven storytelling animations and interactive visualizations, which may provide useful design guidelines for future storytelling and scientific visualization techniques. © 2016 Society for Imaging Science and Technology.",Society for Imaging Science and Technology,"Visualization and Data Analysis 2017, VDA 2017",29 January 2017 through 2 February 2017,"Yu L., Harrison L., Lu A.",36624681000;26666810600;23492979800;,"Yu, L., University of North Carolina at Charlotte, Charlotte, NC  28223, United States; Harrison, L., University of North Carolina at Charlotte, Charlotte, NC  28223, United States; Lu, A., University of North Carolina at Charlotte, Charlotte, NC  28223, United States",IS and T International Symposium on Electronic Imaging Science and Technology,IS T Intl.

Display systems for visualization and simulation in virtual environments,2017,2-s2.0-85040200151,"Standard desktop setups, even with multiple monitor configurations, only provide a somewhat small view on the data set at hand.

Spatial data visualization: The appropriate use of colours,2017,2-s2.0-85032570163,"Colours have a unique position among all the principles of map design and visualisation of spatial data. Colours are a part of map language, and they carry the information value. Also, colours are used for creating the hierarchy of map elements by distinguishing the important from the unimportant. Furthermore, colours are a part of the whole graphic design of any visualisation of spatial data. There is a huge number of papers focusing the theoretical basis of colour use in cartography and spatial data visualisation, but widely useful tools for map authors are still missing. The colour is yet a very significant contribution to the cartographic style and perception of maps user. We distinguish between two basic types of colours used in maps: sequential colour schemes for the presentation of quantitative data and colour palettes for the presentation of qualitative data. Many professionals and non-professionals in cartography create a lot of various maps every day with the use of certain representation methods for several elements. Some methods are based on the colour use, so the fact, that colours are often used incorrectly in maps, is a significant problem. One of the frequent mistakes is the use of diverging colour schemes for convergent values, lowering colour intensity or impossibility to distinguish the colours. The contribution is focused on the presentation of the proper use of colours in the spatial data visualisation. There is defined the influence to the map-user perception, linkage to the map styles and there is presented the new tool to proper selection of colours during the map creation. Presented research seeks to explain the appropriate use of colours in spatial data visualisation, focusing the map styles and modern trends in cartographic design. There were created sequential colour schemes and qualitative colour schemes that correspond to cartographic standards and rules, adjusted for people with colour vision deficiency and the indication of suitable colour schemes for particular types of colour vision deficiency. Presented colour schemes are verified by using the on-line questionnaire and eye-tracking technology. All proposed colour schemes are available via on-line web page called Create colour map scales by cartographic styles, made by the first author of this paper. The user of this website can freely use proposed colour schemes for their work. It all aims to widely use presented colour schemes for map creation and hence the number of mistakes in maps will lower. © SGEM2017.

Closest point sparse octree for surface flow visualization,2017,2-s2.0-85041514816,"As datasets continue to increase in size and complexity, new techniques are required to visualize surface flow effectively. In this work, we introduce a novel technique for visualizing flow on arbitrary surface meshes. This new method utilizes the closest point method (CPM), an embedding technique for solving partial differential equations (PDE) on surfaces. The CPM operates by extending values off the surface into the grid and using standard three dimensional PDE stencils to solve embedded two dimensional surface problems. To adapt unsteady flow visualization for the CPM, unsteady flow line integral convolution (UFLIC) is applied in three dimensions to the embedded surface in the grid to visualize flow on an arbitrary surface. To address the increased size and complexity of datasets, we introduce the closest point sparse octree to efficiently represent an embedded surface. By constructing a closest point sparse octree, complex surfaces can be represented in a memory efficient manner. Further, various techniques, such as a Laplacian filter, can be applied more easily to the embedded surface because of the CPM. Finally, the memory efficiency of our new sparse octree approach allows grids to be constructed up to 8,1923 in size on a GPU with 12GB of RAM. © 2017, Society for Imaging Science and Technology.",Society for Imaging Science and Technology,"Visualization and Data Analysis 2017, VDA 2017",29 January 2017 through 2 February 2017,"Kim M., Hansen C.",55266667100;7402974428;,"Kim, M., Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, United States; Hansen, C., Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, United States",IS and T International Symposium on Electronic Imaging Science and Technology,IS T Intl.

Analysis enhanced particle-based flow visualization,2017,2-s2.0-85037335095,"Particle-based fluid simulation (PFS), such as Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) and Position-based Fluid (PBF), is a mesh-free method that has been widely used in various fields, including astrophysics, mechanical engineering, and biomedical engineering for the study of liquid behaviors under different circumstances. Due to its meshless nature, most analysis techniques that are developed for mesh-based data need to be adapted for the analysis of PFS data. In this work, we study a number of flow analysis techniques and their extension for PFS data analysis, including the FTLE approach, Jacobian analysis, and an attribute accumlation framework. In particular, we apply these analysis techniques to free surface fluids. We demonstrate that these analyses can reveal some interesting underlying flow patterns that would be hard to see otherwise via a number of PFS simulated flows with different parameters and boundary settings. In addition, we point out that an in-situ analysis framework that performs these analyses can potentially be used to guide the adaptive PFS to allocate the computation and storage power to the regions of interest during the simulation. © 2017, Society for Imaging Science and Technology.",Society for Imaging Science and Technology,"Visualization and Data Analysis 2017, VDA 2017",29 January 2017 through 2 February 2017,"Shi L., Zhang L., Cao W., Chen G.",57200526268;57038354600;57200530149;36615204700;,"Shi, L., University of Houston, Houston, TX, United States; Zhang, L., University of Houston, Houston, TX, United States; Cao, W., University of Houston, Houston, TX, United States; Chen, G., University of Houston, Houston, TX, United States",IS and T International Symposium on Electronic Imaging Science and Technology,IS T Intl.

Legislative aspects of spatial data publication,2017,2-s2.0-85032500416,"In spatial data processing, the area of legislation is crucial but often neglected by the expert's community. Knowledge of the various legal aspects related to the data collection, data processing, and analysis of data, as well as publishing the results of spatial analysis and its visualization, is an essential prerequisite for effective work. Legislative aspects are understood as a set of legislative standards, their relationships and their influence on other fields of human activity. In the context of geoinformatics legislative aspect means how standards and legal rules affect the spatial data processing, visualisation and publication. From a legal standpoint, this includes the issues of copyright, individual and industrial property protection, investment protection, etc. It is one of the most important non-technological aspects in geoinformatics and cartography. Intellectual property and law, in general, is crucial in the era of the information society. Often the debate over the appropriate scope of intellectual property protection for spatial data and geodatabases ignores the role of cartography and spatial data uniqueness in the setting of the rights. The law necessarily requires the authorization to apply the right to use a work to another person, but there are possible arrangements and licensing agreements where no such authorization is needed, and open data are the trend in contemporary society. Therefore, knowledge of licensing becomes essential for the process of modern GIScience production. Due to the territoriality of jurisdiction, it is crucial to understand the specific legal terms and conditions. The uniqueness of spatial data compared to other information, is that it is often necessary to combine different data sources. Moreover, it is the combination of the various data sources that often cause a problem because of the requirement for particular licences. © SGEM2017.

Visual-interactive semi-supervised labeling of human motion capture data,2017,2-s2.0-85041514902,"The characterization and abstraction of large multivariate time series data often poses challenges with respect to effectiveness or efficiency. Using the example of human motion capture data challenges exist in creating compact solutions that still reflect semantics and kinematics in a meaningful way. We present a visual-interactive approach for the semi-supervised labeling of human motion capture data. Users are enabled to assign labels to the data which can subsequently be used to represent the multivariate time series as sequences of motion classes. The approach combines multiple views supporting the user in the visual-interactive labeling process. Visual guidance concepts further ease the labeling process by propagating the results of supportive algorithmic models. The abstraction of motion capture data to sequences of event intervals allows overview and detail-on-demand visualizations even for large and heterogeneous data collections. The guided selection of candidate data for the extension and improvement of the labeling closes the feedback loop of the semi-supervised workflow. We demonstrate the effectiveness and the efficiency of the approach in two usage scenarios, taking visual-interactive learning and human motion synthesis as examples. © 2017, Society for Imaging Science and Technology.",Society for Imaging Science and Technology,"Visualization and Data Analysis 2017, VDA 2017",29 January 2017 through 2 February 2017,"Bernard J., Dobermann E., Vögele A., Krüger B., Kohlhammer J., Fellner D.",26530720800;57200530752;57190127453;26768026900;12767087400;6603799372;,"Bernard, J., Technische Universität Darmstadt, Germany; Dobermann, E., Technische Universität Darmstadt, Germany; Vögele, A., Institute of Computer Graphics, University of Bonn, Germany; Krüger, B., Gokhale Method Institute, Stanford, CA, United States; Kohlhammer, J., Technische Universität Darmstadt, Germany, Fraunhofer Institute for Computer Graphics Research IGD, Darmstadt, Germany; Fellner, D., Technische Universität Darmstadt, Germany, Fraunhofer Institute for Computer Graphics Research IGD, Darmstadt, Germany",IS and T International Symposium on Electronic Imaging Science and Technology,IS T Intl.

Eco-buildings sustainable design in linkage with remote sensing and underground urban agriculture,2017,2-s2.0-85063108136,"Sustainable architecture has always been associated with solar and low-energy objects using natural energy at various stages of their life cycle. The developmental morphology of the buildings influences the urban spatial structure of different scales (city, district, housing estate, quarter, building). Its analysis, which is generally extended to the nearest surroundings and the interior space of buildings, draws attention to the relationship between the energy intensity of buildings and the urban context, which affects the shade of the building and its energy demand. In this respect, the form of objects, their thermal insulation, the intensity of the building, the distance between buildings and the density of the population. In environmental architecture, an important role play remote sensing techniques.

Visual interactive creation and validation of text clustering workflows to explore document collections,2017,2-s2.0-85039068790,"The exploration of text document collections is a complex and cumbersome task. Clustering techniques can help to group documents based on their content for the generation of overviews. However, the underlying clustering workflows comprising preprocessing, feature selection, clustering algorithm selection and parameterization offer several degrees of freedom. Since no ""best"" clustering workflow exists, users have to evaluate clustering results based on the data and analysis tasks at hand. In our approach, we present an interactive system for the creation and validation of text clustering workflows with the goal to explore document collections. The system allows users to control every step of the text clustering workflow. First, users are supported in the feature selection process via feature selection metrics-based feature ranking and linguistic filtering (e.g., part-of-speech filtering). Second, users can choose between different clustering methods and their parameterizations.

Visual decision support for business ecosystem analysis,2016,2-s2.0-84984633268,"This study comparatively evaluates the effectiveness of three visualization methods (list, matrix, network) and the influence of data complexity, task type, and user characteristics on decision performance in the context of business ecosystem analysis. We pursue this objective using an exploratory study with 14 prototypical users (e.g. executives, analysts, investors, and policy makers). The results show that in low complexity contexts, decision performance between visual representations differ but not substantially. In high complexity contexts, however, decision performance suffers significantly if visual representations are not appropriately matched to task types. Our study makes several theoretical and practical contributions. Theoretically, we extend cognitive fit theory by investigating the impact of business ecosystem task type and complexity. Managerially, our study contributes to the relatively underexplored, but emerging area of the design of business ecosystem intelligence tools and presentation of business ecosystem data for the purpose of decision making.

Using lag-sequential analysis for understanding interaction sequences in visualizations,2016,2-s2.0-84981748196,"The investigation of how users make sense of the data provided by information systems is very important for human computer interaction. In this context, understanding the interaction processes of users plays an important role. The analysis of interaction sequences, for example, can provide a deeper understanding about how users solve problems. In this paper we present an analysis of sequences of interactions within a visualization system and compare the results to previous research. We used log file analysis and thinking aloud as methods. There is some indication based on log file analysis that there are interaction patterns which can be generalized. Thinking aloud indicates that some cognitive processes occur together with a higher probability than others. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Academic Press,,,"Pohl M., Wallner G., Kriglstein S.",7202059582;26032727500;24802062000;,"Pohl, M., Institute for Design and Assessment of Technology, Vienna University of Technology, Argentinierstrasse 8, Vienna, 1040, Austria; Wallner, G., Institute of Art and Technology, University of Applied Arts Vienna, Oskar Kokoschka Platz 2, Vienna, 1010, Austria; Kriglstein, S., Institute for Design and Assessment of Technology, Vienna University of Technology, Argentinierstrasse 8, Vienna, 1040, Austria",International Journal of Human Computer Studies,Int J Hum Comput Stud,5.0
"Development of computational module of regional aridity for web-GIS ""climate""",2016,2-s2.0-85009384614,"Modern global climate changes are characterized by a significant warming started in the late 1970s. According to the observation data, the average rate of warming in Russia for 1976-2012 was 0.43 °C/10 years. Additionally, the trend of annual precipitation for the same period in most parts of Russia is positive. To study the integral climate characteristics of a region, in particular, hydrothermal conditions, is of great interest. A new software module for the assessment of aridity was developed and added to an information and computing web system called ""Climate"". The well-known hydrothermal coefficient of Selyaninov (HTC) was used with ECMWF ERA Interim reanalysis data for the period from 1979 to 2010. The input data (precipitation, temperature, HTC) were validated using observation data from weather stations. It was found that the ERA Interim data substantially (by 50%) underestimated the measured precipitation in the study region. The precipitation was corrected by the results. New spatially distributed precipitation and HTC data were obtained. The web system ""Climate"" is based on web and GIS techniques and is part of a hardware and software complex for ""cloud"" analysis of climatic data. It includes several climatological and meteorological datasets, as well as dedicated software modules for searching, selection, extraction, and visualization of data. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",Institute of Physics Publishing,"9th International Conference and Early Career Scientists School on Environmental Observations, Modelling and Information Systems, ENVIROMIS 2016",11 July 2016 through 16 July 2016,"Riazanova A.A., Voropay N.N., Okladnikov I.G., Gordov E.P.",57199505297;54796360800;10140476700;22967052700;,"Riazanova, A.A., Institute of Monitoring of Climatic and Ecological Systems, SB RAS, Tomsk, Russian Federation, V.

Development of climate data storage and processing model,2016,2-s2.0-85009399997,"We present a storage and processing model for climate datasets elaborated in the framework of a virtual research environment (VRE) for climate and environmental monitoring and analysis of the impact of climate change on the socio-economic processes on local and regional scales. The model is based on a shared nothings distributed computing architecture and assumes using a computing network where each computing node is independent and selfsufficient. Each node holds a dedicated software for the processing and visualization of geospatial data providing programming interfaces to communicate with the other nodes. The nodes are interconnected by a local network or the Internet and exchange data and control instructions via SSH connections and web services. Geospatial data is represented by collections of netCDF files stored in a hierarchy of directories in the framework of a file system. To speed up data reading and processing, three approaches are proposed: a precalculation of intermediate products, a distribution of data across multiple storage systems (with or without redundancy), and caching and reuse of the previously obtained products. For a fast search and retrieval of the required data, according to the data storage and processing model, a metadata database is developed. It contains descriptions of the space-time features of the datasets available for processing, their locations, as well as descriptions and run options of the software components for data analysis and visualization. The model and the metadata database together will provide a reliable technological basis for development of a high- performance virtual research environment for climatic and environmental monitoring. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",Institute of Physics Publishing,"9th International Conference and Early Career Scientists School on Environmental Observations, Modelling and Information Systems, ENVIROMIS 2016",11 July 2016 through 16 July 2016,"Okladnikov I.G., Gordov E.P., Titov A.G.",10140476700;22967052700;56343587400;,"Okladnikov, I.G., Instutite of Monitoring of Climatic and Ecological Systems, Siberian Branch, Russian Academy of Sciences, 10/3, Akademichesky pr., Tomsk, 634055, Russian Federation, Institute of Computational Technologies, Siberian Branch, Russian Academy of Sciences, Tomsk Branch, 10/4, Akademichesky pr., Tomsk, Russian Federation, Instutite of Atmospheric Optics, Siberian Branch, Russian Academy of Sciences, 1, V.E.

Environmental science applications with Rapid Integrated Mapping and analysis System (RIMS),2016,2-s2.0-85009357392,"The Rapid Integrated Mapping and analysis System (RIMS) has been developed at the University of New Hampshire as an online instrument for multidisciplinary data visualization, analysis and manipulation with a focus on hydrological applications. Recently it was enriched with data and tools to allow more sophisticated analysis of interdisciplinary data. Three different examples of specific scientific applications with RIMS are demonstrated and discussed. Analysis of historical changes in major components of the Eurasian pan-Arctic water budget is based on historical discharge data, gridded observational meteorological fields, and remote sensing data for sea ice area. Express analysis of the extremely hot and dry summer of 2010 across European Russia is performed using a combination of near-real time and historical data to evaluate the intensity and spatial distribution of this event and its socioeconomic impacts. Integrative analysis of hydrological, water management, and population data for Central Asia over the last 30 years provides an assessment of regional water security due to changes in climate, water use and demography. The presented case studies demonstrate the capabilities of RIMS as a powerful instrument for hydrological and coupled human-natural systems research. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",Institute of Physics Publishing,"9th International Conference and Early Career Scientists School on Environmental Observations, Modelling and Information Systems, ENVIROMIS 2016",11 July 2016 through 16 July 2016,"Shiklomanov A., Prusevich A., Gordov E., Okladnikov I., Titov A.",6602479200;36572451300;22967052700;10140476700;56343587400;,"Shiklomanov, A., Earth Systems Research Center, UNH, Durham, NH, United States, P.P.Shirshov Institute of Oceanology, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russian Federation, Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute, St. Petersburg, Russian Federation; Prusevich, A., Earth Systems Research Center, UNH, Durham, NH, United States; Gordov, E., Institute of Monitoring of Climatic and Ecological Systems, Siberian Branch, Russian Academy of Sciences, Tomsk, Russian Federation, Tomsk State University, Tomsk, Russian Federation, Institute of Computational Technologies, Siberian Branch, Russian Academy of Sciences, Tomsk Branch, Tomsk, Russian Federation; Okladnikov, I., Institute of Monitoring of Climatic and Ecological Systems, Siberian Branch, Russian Academy of Sciences, Tomsk, Russian Federation, Institute of Computational Technologies, Siberian Branch, Russian Academy of Sciences, Tomsk Branch, Tomsk, Russian Federation; Titov, A., Institute of Monitoring of Climatic and Ecological Systems, Siberian Branch, Russian Academy of Sciences, Tomsk, Russian Federation, Institute of Computational Technologies, Siberian Branch, Russian Academy of Sciences, Tomsk Branch, Tomsk, Russian Federation",IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science,IOP Conf.

Centrality clustering-based sampling for big data visualization,2016,2-s2.0-85007228570,"Information visualization is essential for improving effectiveness and efficiency of data exploration and knowledge discovery. Therefore, visualization has been used in a wide range of fields from biology, medicine, criminal activity analysis to business and education. Information visualization has become more important than ever as the amount of data being generated has increased dramatically in recent years. One of the major difficulties of information visualization is performance, and this is even more critical when visualizing big data. One potential solution to this challenge is data sampling while maintaining fidelity of visual representation. In this paper, we propose two new centrality clustering-based sampling approaches that apply centrality measures on clusters of data points in order to make more informed sampling than random sampling approaches. We evaluate the new methods on graph data sets. The results show that the new methods significantly outperform existing data sampling methods in term of perceived differences and their ability to preserve essential visual information. Moreover computational complexity is comparable or even better than simple random sampling methods. © 2016 IEEE.",Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, IJCNN 2016",24 July 2016 through 29 July 2016,"Nguyen T.T., Song I.",57209166222;13610410800;,"Nguyen, T.T., School of Business/IT, James Cook University Australia, Singapore Campus, Singapore, Singapore; Song, I., School of Business/IT, James Cook University Australia, Singapore Campus, Singapore, Singapore",Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks,Proc Int Jt Conf Neural Networks,4.0
Learning space model for educational social networks,2016,2-s2.0-85007275987,"Learning now occurs in various manners in social networks, utilizing practice communities and learning networks. In this context, students are interested in exploring learning activities of other students without having to read through large quantities of textual content. Students tend to be interested in finding information concerning their majors, contents of their subjects and their co-learners. However, with the huge amount of information available, it is difficult for users to identify relevant information. Visualization comes in to help improve the situation. In this paper, we identify opportunities for deploying visualization in educational social networks to enhance learners' efficiency, effectiveness and learning experiences. We present a new learning space model designed to capture learning activities in educational social networks. A new 3D visualization system for the learning space model is also developed to help users obtain a better understanding of learning activities in social networks. We evaluate our approaches on educational social networks using real data. The evaluation results show that our approach of visualizing learning activities helps learners grasp a better overview of their study environment. Also, the learning process is perceived as easier, more engaging and more fun for the users, compared to traditional ways of displaying information. © 2016 IEEE.",Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, IJCNN 2016",24 July 2016 through 29 July 2016,"Nguyen T.T., Song I.",57209166222;13610410800;,"Nguyen, T.T., School of Business/IT, James Cook University Australia, Singapore Campus, Singapore, Singapore; Song, I., School of Business/IT, James Cook University Australia, Singapore Campus, Singapore, Singapore",Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks,Proc Int Jt Conf Neural Networks,
Application of GIS and Remote Sensing Techniques in Multitemporal Analyses of Soil Properties in the Foreland of the Carpathians,2016,2-s2.0-85000893991,"The paper presents a spatial and temporal analysis of the distribution of the soil salinity and its pH level of south-east Poland depending on selected environmental factors. The area under examination (Carpathian Foredeep, Carpathians flysch) is distinguished by its specific hydrological and geological conditions (the Vistula and the San valley). The research works were performed in relation to parameters that had been measured in-situ in 1995, 2000, 2005, and 2010. Using specialist GIS software, proper interpolation procedures were performed, which enabled visualization in the form of raster and vector maps for the spatial distribution of the examined soil properties. Moreover, an analysis of remote sensing data was completed. Based on the analysis, it was discovered that the biggest changes in all examined soil parameters took place in 2010-changes in the soil salinity and its pH level, as well as in the content of potassium (K) and sodium (Na). Those changes occurred mainly in the north and south parts of the examined area.

Personal informatics for everyday life: How users without prior self-tracking experience engage with personal data,2016,2-s2.0-84971592065,"The spreading of devices and applications allowing people to collect personal information opens new opportunities for Personal Informatics. Although many of these tools are already effectively used by motivated people to gain self-knowledge and produce change in their behaviors, there is a great number of users that are potentially interested in Personal Informatics but do not know of its potentialities and criticalities. In order to investigate how users perceive and use self-tracking tools in everyday life, we conducted a diary study, requiring fourteen participants with no previous experience in Personal Informatics to use a variety of trackers. We discovered that they use and perceive these technologies differently from the ones experienced in self-tracking. Participants considered the act of collecting personal information burdensome, with no beneficial reward. We also uncovered a series of problems that they experienced while tracking, managing, visualizing, and using their data. Among them we found that the lack of suggestions on using data and the excess of abstract visualization in the apps prevented users to gain useful insights. As a result, their interest in self-tracking soon faded, despite their initial curiosity in exploring and ""playing"" with their data. Starting from the findings of this study, we identified seven design strategies to better Personal Informatics tools, supported by literature and examples that draw from different research fields, from tangible interfaces, to virtual environments and video games. These strategies are primarily addressed to satisfy the inexperienced users' needs, but their applicability can be reasonably extended to all the individuals curious and interested in Personal Informatics. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",Academic Press,,,"Rapp A., Cena F.",23398572100;8216952800;,"Rapp, A., University of Torino, Computer Science Department, C.so Svizzera, 185, Torino, 10149, Italy; Cena, F., University of Torino, Computer Science Department, C.so Svizzera, 185, Torino, 10149, Italy",International Journal of Human Computer Studies,Int J Hum Comput Stud,50.0
InteGO2: A web tool for measuring and visualizing gene semantic similarities using Gene Ontology,2016,2-s2.0-84984700595,"Background: The Gene Ontology (GO) has been used in high-throughput omics research as a major bioinformatics resource. The hierarchical structure of GO provides users a convenient platform for biological information abstraction and hypothesis testing. Computational methods have been developed to identify functionally similar genes. However, none of the existing measurements take into account all the rich information in GO. Similarly, using these existing methods, web-based applications have been constructed to compute gene functional similarities, and to provide pure text-based outputs. Without a graphical visualization interface, it is difficult for result interpretation. Results: We present InteGO2, a web tool that allows researchers to calculate the GO-based gene semantic similarities using seven widely used GO-based similarity measurements. Also, we provide an integrative measurement that synergistically integrates all the individual measurements to improve the overall performance. Using HTML5 and cytoscape.js, we provide a graphical interface in InteGO2 to visualize the resulting gene functional association networks. Conclusions: InteGO2 is an easy-to-use HTML5 based web tool. With it, researchers can measure gene or gene product functional similarity conveniently, and visualize the network of functional interactions in a graphical interface.

Managing construction schedule by telepresence: Integration of site video feed with an active nD CAD simulation,2016,2-s2.0-84964828598,"In recent years, the increased utilization of building information modeling (BIM) has brought attention to the need for BIM-based operation systems that provide a decision-making feature in addition to visual information. This study constructed a project schedule management system that integrates the data points of an nD computer-aided design (CAD) object (e.g., schedule and resource information) with a telepresence concept video management operation system. A methodology was developed that allows the user to monitor the current construction status relative to the design and verify the completion of the facility through real-time comparison between the planned process represented by the nD object and the actual image of the construction site sent from an on-site webcam. An active nD CAD system was developed that possesses features such as a comparative simulation between the on-site image and a 4D object to minimize interference between processes and a 5D object that is specialized to the resource mobilization level of the field. A telepresence-based nD CAD system was developed based on this methodology, and the practicality of the system was verified by webcams installed on a bridge construction site. Thus, the project manager is not only able to utilize the nD object for visualization but is also able to use the system as a decision-making system to formulate the most appropriate project schedule by comparing the nD object with the actual on-site image. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

FlowVisual: A visualization app for teaching and understanding 3D flow field concepts,2016,2-s2.0-85040622755,"The study of fluid behaviors has been a challenging topic. Flow visualization enables us to visually acquire qualitative and quantitative flow information. There exist various software tools performing different flow visualization tasks. However, we lack tools that help students learn important flow field concepts. In this paper, we present a visualization app, named FlowVisual which runs on iOS devices, to illustrate basic flow field concepts in 3D. In order to meet a comprehensive learning goal for stu- dents, we integrate a number of techniques into FlowVisual de- sign, including field-line tracing, field-line comparison, critical point detection and classification, template-based seeding, and surface visualization.

Development of a visualization tool for integrated surface water-groundwater modeling,2016,2-s2.0-84944261700,"Physically-based, fully integrated surface water (SW)-groundwater (GW) models have been increasingly used in water resources research and management. The integrated modeling involves a large amount of scientific data. The use of three-dimensional (3D) visualization software to integrate all the scientific data into a comprehensive system can facilitate the interpretation and validation of modeling results. Nevertheless, at present few software tools can efficiently perform data visualization for integrated SW-GW modeling. In this study, a visualization tool named IHM3D was designed and developed specifically for integrated SW-GW modeling. In IHM3D, spatially distributed model inputs/outputs and geo-referenced data sets are visualized in a virtual globe-based 3D environment. End users can conveniently explore and validate modeling results within the 3D environment. A GSLFOW (an integrated SW-GW model developed by USGS) modeling case in the Heihe River Basin (Northwest China) was used to demonstrate the applicability of IHM3D at a large basin scale. The visualization of the modeling results significantly improved the understanding of the complex hydrologic cycle in this water-limited area, and provided insights into the regional water resources management. This study shows that visualization tools like IHM3D can promote data and model sharing in the water resources research community, and make it more practical to perform complex hydrological modeling in real-world water resources management. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Elsevier Ltd,,,"Tian Y., Zheng Y., Zheng C.",56117176800;56409084200;7401934994;,"Tian, Y., School of Environmental Science and Engineering, South University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, 518055, China, College of Engineering, Peking University, Beijing, 100871, China; Zheng, Y., College of Engineering, Peking University, Beijing, 100871, China; Zheng, C., School of Environmental Science and Engineering, South University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, 518055, China, College of Engineering, Peking University, Beijing, 100871, China, Department of Geological Sciences, University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL  35487, United States",Computers and Geosciences,Comput.

Ensemble Traces: Interactive visualization of ensemble multivariate time series data,2016,2-s2.0-85040558241,"This paper presents a simple yet effective approach to visualizing ensemble multivariate time series as 3D traces. Ensemble multivariate time series data are common in many areas. This type of data contains large amount of information which is often crucial to both knowledge discovery and decision making. Visualization can be employed to help the researchers quickly gain insight from the data. First, we project all multivariate data points to a 2D projection plane with a dimension reduction algorithm. Then we expand the data points of any ensemble member back into a trace in the 3D space spanned by the 2D projection plane and time. The resulting 3D ensemble traces provide a holistic and consistent view of the original ensemble multivariate time series. These traces are useful for revealing differences between ensembles, identifying groups and outliers, and catching temporal trends. In addition, we interactively link the ensemble traces to a panel of single variable plots. The combined visualization of raw data plots and multivariate ensemble traces provide a unique perspective to patterns and trends. We studied 3 different dimension reduction algorithms, i.e., t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t- SNE), classic Multidimensional Scaling (MDS), and Locally Linear Embedding (LLE). We demonstrated our approach with two different datasets and evaluated our methods with domain experts. © 2016 Society for Imaging Science and Technology.",Society for Imaging Science and Technology,"23rd Visualization and Data Analysis Conference, VDA 2016",14 February 2016 through 18 February 2016,"Singh S., Zhang S., Pruett W.A., Hester R.",57200270410;7409373748;54684805800;26540875700;,"Singh, S., Mississippi State University, Mississippi State, MS, United States; Zhang, S., Mississippi State University, Mississippi State, MS, United States; Pruett, W.A., University of Mississippi Medical Center, Jackson, MS, United States; Hester, R., University of Mississippi Medical Center, Jackson, MS, United States",IS and T International Symposium on Electronic Imaging Science and Technology,IS T Intl.

Flow visualization based on a derived rotation field,2016,2-s2.0-85040590582,"In this paper, we apply a derived scalar field, called the φ field, to assist the visualization of various flow data. The value of the φ field at a spatio-Temporal location is determined by the accumulated angle changes of the tangent directions along the integral curve starting from this location. Important properties of the φ field and its gradient magnitude Vφ field are studied. In particular, we show that the patterns in the derived φ field are generally aligned with the flow direction based on an inequality property. In addition, we compare the φ field with some other attribute fields and discuss its relation with a number of flow features, such as topology, LCS and cusp-like seeding structures. Furthermore, we introduce a unified framework for the computation of the φ field and its gradient field, and employ them to a number of flow visualization and exploration tasks, including integral curve filtering, seeds generation and flow domain segmentation. We show that these tasks can be conducted more efficiently based on the information encoded in the φ field and its gradient. © 2016 Society for Imaging Science and Technology.",Society for Imaging Science and Technology,"23rd Visualization and Data Analysis Conference, VDA 2016",14 February 2016 through 18 February 2016,"Zhang L., Chen G., Laramee R.S., Thompson D., Sescu A.",57038354600;36615204700;6507636353;57212279672;22952031300;,"Zhang, L., University of Houston, Houston, TX, United States; Chen, G., University of Houston, Houston, TX, United States; Laramee, R.S., Swansea University, United Kingdom; Thompson, D., Mississippi State University, Mississippi, MS, United States; Sescu, A., Mississippi State University, Mississippi, MS, United States",IS and T International Symposium on Electronic Imaging Science and Technology,IS T Intl.

Exploiting regions of influence to visualize class boundaries,2016,2-s2.0-85040541372,"Interactive visualization and analysis of the class boundaries is important because it tells us how and why the classes differ. However, the problem of modeling the boundary of classes of arbitrary size, shape and density is challenging. The boundary of a class should not be limited to the points/shape which encloses the points within the class but it should be, the points/shape which encloses the region of influence of a class. The ""region of influence"" refers to the space around the class where any point lying within the region is likely to be classified to the class based on a nearest neighbor classifier. We have developed interactive boundary visualization toolkit for classified datasets which provides insights about the classifier model used on the dataset. Our algorithm first generates a candidate boundary set for each class based on reverse k-nearest neighbors approach and extends this boundary iteratively through the region of influence of the class. Further, we present these boundary points enclosing the region of influence as a linear approximated shape using triangulation techniques.

MaVis: Machine learning aided multi-model framework for time series visual analytics,2016,2-s2.0-85040585739,"The ultimate goal of any visual analytic task is to make sense of the data and gain insights. Unfortunately, the continuously growing scale of the data nowadays challenges the traditional data analytics in the ""big-data"" era. Particularly, the human cognitive capabilities are constant whereas the data scale is not. Furthermore, most existing work focus on how to extract interesting information and present that to the user while not emphasizing on how to provide options to the analysts if the extracted information is not interesting. In this paper, we propose a visual analytic tool called MaVis that integrates multiple machine learning models with a plug-Andplay style to describe the input data. It allows the analysts to choose the way they prefer to summarize the data. The MaVis framework provides multiple linked analytic spaces for interpretation at different levels. The low level data space handles data binning strategy while the high level model space handles model summarizations (i.e. clusters or trends). MaVis also supports model analytics that visualize the summarized patterns and compare and contrast them. This framework is shown to provide several novel methods of investigating co-movement patterns of timeseries dataset which is a common interest of medical sciences, finance, business and engineering alike. Lastly we demonstrate the usefulness of our framework via case study and user study using a stock price dataset. © 2016 Society for Imaging Science and Technology.",Society for Imaging Science and Technology,"23rd Visualization and Data Analysis Conference, VDA 2016",14 February 2016 through 18 February 2016,"Zhao K., Ward M., Rundensteiner E., Higgins H.",55976420500;7403169452;7005195084;55664746500;,"Zhao, K., Worcester Polytechnic Institute, United States; Ward, M., Worcester Polytechnic Institute, United States; Rundensteiner, E., Worcester Polytechnic Institute, United States; Higgins, H., Worcester Polytechnic Institute, United States",IS and T International Symposium on Electronic Imaging Science and Technology,IS T Intl.

Segmentation of zebrafish larva inhomogeneous 3dimages using the level-setmethod,2016,2-s2.0-85040561879,"Image local information is crucial for accurate segmentation of images with inhomogeneities in the intensity. In many popular methods, however, local regional information is normally under- estimated and not included in the segmentation framework. In this paper, a segmentation is formalised as Bayesian Inference procedure. By considering the spatial variation of the inten- sity distribution, a likelihood that contains a joint distribution of intensity and spatial location is obtained. After incorporating this likelihood in a Bayesian maximum a posteriori estimation, we transformed the stochastic model into a segmentation method which utilises local information to segment images with inhomo- geneities so as to guarantee a global optimum for the two-region case(foreground/background). Taking the computational complex- ity of our model into account, we take advantage of a GPU parallel algorithm to accelerate computation without losing segmentation accuracy. We demonstrate that taking into account local image information, our method results in significant improvements for image segmentation. © 2016 Society for Imaging Science and Technology.",Society for Imaging Science and Technology,"23rd Visualization and Data Analysis Conference, VDA 2016",14 February 2016 through 18 February 2016,"Zhan X., Verbeek F.J.",57200275364;6701677480;,"Zhan, X., Advanced Computer Science Institute, Leiden University, Leiden, Netherlands; Verbeek, F.J., Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science, Imaging and BioInformatics, Leiden, Netherlands",IS and T International Symposium on Electronic Imaging Science and Technology,IS T Intl.

We consider the regions where bifurcation in flow trends among the EVF members occur.

"Interactive high-dimensional data analysis using the ""three experts""",2016,2-s2.0-85040580507,"With the increasing availability of data from various domains such as health care, finance, social networks, etc. there is a need to provide analytic tools that are more accessible to lay people. In this paper, we present a software tool which can be used to aid inexperienced users in understanding high dimensional data. To facilitate the understanding of such data, we place special emphasis on how the data is presented, using the ""Three Experts"". The Three Experts display shows the results of three different dimension reduction techniques, similar in notion to seeking several expert opinions on a particular topic. This will help the user to discern between pertinent structures in the data, and those resulting from distortions inherent in dimension reduction. The second emphasis is on providing the ability for users to insert and manipulate new points within the data, as well as observe high dimensional trajectories to convey positional displacement of points. Observing these changes will enable the user to develop an actionable intuition for the data in question. These methods could be used in any field where high dimensional numeric data needs to be analyzed, with potential benefits for both novice and expert users. © 2016 Society for Imaging Science and Technology.",Society for Imaging Science and Technology,"23rd Visualization and Data Analysis Conference, VDA 2016",14 February 2016 through 18 February 2016,"Albrecht G., Pang A.",55804835700;7007044166;,"Albrecht, G., University of California at Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA, United States; Pang, A., University of California at Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA, United States",IS and T International Symposium on Electronic Imaging Science and Technology,IS T Intl.

Exploring mass variations in the Earth system,2016,2-s2.0-84947613455,"Geophysical processes cause a redistribution of masses within system Earth called mass transport. This mass transport induces variations in the observed gravity field of the Earth. A common scientific approach to draw conclusions about geophysical processes is to determine the imprint of individual geophysical processes in observed gravity field variations. For this purpose, modelers follow a sequence of specialized steps. From this sequence, we identified in close collaboration with Earth system modelers at the German Research Center for GeoSciences (GFZ) steps that can significantly benefit from Visual Analytics: (a) finding an applicable release of observed gravity field variations that exhibit the geophysical process of interest (b) separating individual geophysical processes in observed gravity field variations and (c) confirming the reduction of observed gravity field variations to the geophysical process of interest.We identified important analytical requirements for our Visual Analytics approach based on a user- and task-centered design.

A method to support search string building in systematic literature reviews through visual text mining,2015,2-s2.0-84955506934,"Despite the increasing popularity of systematic literature reviews in Software Engineering, several researchers still indicate it as a costly and challenging process.

In order to do so, the method extracts relevant terms from studies selected by the researcher and displays them in a way that facilitate their visualization and supports building and refining the search string. In order to check the feasibility of this approach, we developed a tool that implements the proposed method. Interviews with researchers identified their difficulties in performing systematic reviews and captured their feedback with regards the use of the proposed method in a user study. The researchers indicated that this approach could be used to improve the process of building the search strings for systematic reviews.

Spatio-temporal visualization of air-sea CO2 flux and carbon budget using volume rendering,2015,2-s2.0-84961342893,"This paper presents a novel visualization method to show the spatio-temporal dynamics of carbon sinks and sources, and carbon fluxes in the ocean carbon cycle. The air-sea carbon budget and its process of accumulation are demonstrated in the spatial dimension, while the distribution pattern and variation of CO2 flux are expressed by color changes. In this way, we unite spatial and temporal characteristics of satellite data through visualization. A GPU-based direct volume rendering technique using half-angle slicing is adopted to dynamically visualize the released or absorbed CO2 gas with shadow effects. A data model is designed to generate four-dimensional (4D) data from satellite-derived air-sea CO2 flux products, and an out-of-core scheduling strategy is also proposed for on-the-fly rendering of time series of satellite data. The presented 4D visualization method is implemented on graphics cards with vertex, geometry and fragment shaders.

Interactive visualization and analysis of eye biomechanics,2015,2-s2.0-84969263264,"Modeling realistic eye movements is an active area of research and can provide useful information related to brain and neurological diseases.

Visualisations and their effect on cognitive biases in the context of criminal intelligence analysis,2015,2-s2.0-84969242940,"Criminal intelligence analysts of today are confronted with a veritable explosion in data volume. They are constantly required to make sense of these data and consequently to make appropriate decisions. To effectively manage the complexity of information and to avoid to be overwhelmed by it, humans unconsciously apply heuristics. These heuristics, although generally useful, can lead to systematic errors in judgment, so-called cognitive biases. Research in the area of information visualisation has shown a positive effect of visualisations on the sense-making process by supporting humans in their understanding and interpreting of large data sets. This paper gives an overview of the current research in the following two areas (1) cognitive biases with its mitigation strategies and (2) information visualisation. This paper also demonstrates that more research is necessary to link these both research areas together by investigating the effect of visualisations on cognitive biases during the sense-making process.",IADIS,"International Conferences on Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction 2015, IHCI 2015, Game and Entertainment Technologies 2015, GET 2015 and Computer Graphics, Visualization, Computer Vision and Image Processing 2015, CGVCVIP 2015 - Part of the Multi Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems 2015",22 July 2015 through 24 July 2015,"Hillemann E.-C., Nussbaumer A., Albert D.",43261415200;22835681600;7202958912;,"Hillemann, E.-C., Knowledge Technologies Institute, Graz University of Technology, Inffeldgasse 13/5, Graz, A-8010, Austria; Nussbaumer, A., Knowledge Technologies Institute, Graz University of Technology, Inffeldgasse 13/5, Graz, A-8010, Austria; Albert, D., Knowledge Technologies Institute, Graz University of Technology, Inffeldgasse 13/5, Graz, A-8010, Austria","Proceedings of the International Conferences on Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction 2015, IHCI 2015, Game and Entertainment Technologies 2015, GET 2015 and Computer Graphics, Visualization, Computer Vision and Image Processing 2015, CGVCVIP 2015 - Part of the Multi Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems 2015","Proc.

Visualization of the karst development dynamics by spatial-temporal maps,2015,2-s2.0-84964311475,"During the observation of the karst processes there is a problem visualization of its dynamics. For this can be used geographic information system. All information on existing forms of karst processes can connected to the map based on the coordinates. But there is a need to include into GIS the information about the dynamics of the karst processes. There is a big problem to solve this task in traditional GIS. Development of karst processes has features that affect their visualization in GIS: the shape and the state of karst objects may change; existing karst forms can be replaced with new objects; the frequency of state changes and appearance of new objects is small; cartographic basis (map) may change as a result of the impact of natural phenomena and human activities. To solve the problem can be used spatial-temporal GIS. In paper the basic features of the karst processes development that affect their storage and display on maps are given. The questions of organization of karst processes dynamics visualization on the basis of spatial-temporal maps are presented.

Self-organizing maps with information theoretic learning,2015,2-s2.0-84924527117,"The self-organizing map (SOM) is one of the popular clustering and data visualization algorithms and has evolved as a useful tool in pattern recognition, data mining since it was first introduced by Kohonen. However, it is observed that the magnification factor for such mappings deviates from the information-theoretically optimal value of 1 (for the SOM it is 2/3). This can be attributed to the use of the mean square error to adapt the system, which distorts the mapping by oversampling the low probability regions.In this work, we first discuss the kernel SOM in terms of a similarity measure called correntropy induced metric (CIM) and empirically show that this can enhance the magnification of the mapping without much increase in the computational complexity of the algorithm. We also show that adapting the SOM in the CIM sense is equivalent to reducing the localized cross information potential, an information-theoretic function that quantifies the similarity between two probability distributions. Using this property we propose a kernel bandwidth adaptation algorithm for Gaussian kernels, with both homoscedastic and heteroscedastic components. We show that the proposed model can achieve a mapping with optimal magnification and can automatically adapt the parameters of the kernel function. © 2014.",Elsevier,,,"Chalasani R., Principe J.C.",24829078600;36045958600;,"Chalasani, R., Computational NeuroEngineering Lab, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL  32608, United States; Principe, J.C., Computational NeuroEngineering Lab, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL  32608, United States",Neurocomputing,Neurocomputing,11.0
Real-time visualizing multi-field simulation data in earth climate science,2015,2-s2.0-84969269122,"Recent advances in high performance computing technologies are increasing the model complexity, model resolution and the number of simulations in the climate science. Interactive exploration and analysis of these complex, multi-field climate data sets has been identified as one of the major current challenges in scientific visualization today. Without direct 3D multi-field visualization it is hard to see, for example, important correlative effects between vertical wind velocities and transport of volumetric atmosphere. Since the data have complicated 3D structures and are highly time-dependent, the visualization approach must handle this dynamic data in a highly interactive way. In this paper we propose a real-time multi-field visualization framework for earth climate simulation data. A novel visualization pipeline is presented for on-demand data processing, enabling scalable handling large-scale climate dataset.

3D cartography and geovisualization based on gis and geovrml for an open access landform investigation and analysis within an open web platform (OWP),2015,2-s2.0-84946414714,"Interactive geovisualization is an emerging field based upon many approaches from many fields and disciplines to provide theory, methods and tools for the visual exploration, synthesis and presentation of data that contains geographic information. Therefore, there has been considerable interest in spatial data visualization employing Virtual Reality and geographical information system (GIS) platform, and considered as an interesting tool for data investigation and dynamic visualization. The approach, integrated with Web technology, seems to be a powerful geospatial web-based 3D geographical cartography, visualization and analysis solution and, obviously, will becomes an important part of the future of the geovisualization. In this study, numerous morphostructural landscapes and some particular Triassic geomorphic landforms located within northern Tunisia have been considered to visualize their 3D terrain models and, specially, some significant GIS-based quantitative morphometric parameters extracted from accurate DEMs (Digital Elevation Models) are concerned. GeoVRML (Geographic Virtual Reality Modelling Language) with an inherent support of georeferenced models are produced to enable interactive visualization and 3D cartography on the World Wide Web using any Web browser with freely-available plugins and tools. Therefore, Web user interfaces were created based on the basic open web platform (OWP) standards. In fact, HTML5, XML, CSS3, and SVG are used and considered as the essential part of this designed open access platform. SVG, or the scalable vector graphics is used to manipulate original two-dimensional graphics and created GIS layers with support for interactivity. Moreover, a descriptive metadata of each layer is also integrated. Authoring and conversion of geospatial data to GeoVRML is carried out using GIS environment and, thereafter, connected to the Web interface. Three-dimensional GeoVRML scenes show an interesting ease of use with innovative VRML nodes more suitable for 3D cartography and scientific geovisualization dealing with geospatial data. Consequently, geographic coordinate systems, high precision, dataset scalability, and metadata linking are involved. GeoCoordinate, GeoElevationGrid, GeoLOcation, and GeoLOD are among the most practical used nodes. In this work, the ability to model dynamic 3D geographic data that can be distributed and interactively visualized over the web is emphasized. © SGEM2015.",International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference,"15th International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference and EXPO, SGEM 2015",18 June 2015 through 24 June 2015,"Slama T., Turki M.M.",56507554800;6603812918;,"Slama, T., Department of Geology, Université de Tunis El Manar, Tunis, Tunisia; Turki, M.M., Department of Geology, Université de Tunis El Manar, Tunis, Tunisia","International Multidisciplinary Scientific GeoConference Surveying Geology and Mining Ecology Management, SGEM","Int.

According to their computational amounts, the data patches are distributed to the processing cores balancedly, and accordingly load imbalance in parallel rendering is decreased. Compared with the existing methods such as random assignment and ray estimation, the proposed entropy-based load balancing scheme can achieve a rendering speedup ratio of 1.23∼2.84.

Parametric nonlinear dimensionality reduction using kernel t-SNE,2015,2-s2.0-84924081991,"Novel non-parametric dimensionality reduction techniques such as t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) lead to a powerful and flexible visualization of high-dimensional data. One drawback of non-parametric techniques is their lack of an explicit out-of-sample extension. In this contribution, we propose an efficient extension of t-SNE to a parametric framework, kernel t-SNE, which preserves the flexibility of basic t-SNE, but enables explicit out-of-sample extensions. We test the ability of kernel t-SNE in comparison to standard t-SNE for benchmark data sets, in particular addressing the generalization ability of the mapping for novel data. In the context of large data sets, this procedure enables us to train a mapping for a fixed size subset only, mapping all data afterwards in linear time. We demonstrate that this technique yields satisfactory results also for large data sets provided missing information due to the small size of the subset is accounted for by auxiliary information such as class labels, which can be integrated into kernel t-SNE based on the Fisher information. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",Elsevier,,,"Gisbrecht A., Schulz A., Hammer B.",36655721700;55730167200;55791279400;,"Gisbrecht, A., Bielefeld University - CITEC Centre of Excellence, Germany; Schulz, A., Bielefeld University - CITEC Centre of Excellence, Germany; Hammer, B., Bielefeld University - CITEC Centre of Excellence, Germany",Neurocomputing,Neurocomputing,57.0
TreeQueST: A treemap-based query sandbox for microdocument retrieval,2015,2-s2.0-84944195301,"Scatter/Gather-browsing has been proposed as a technique for information retrieval that fosters understanding of textual data and identification of key documents by means of exploration and drill-down. It has been found that such approaches are more expensive but not more effective than less interactive search solutions for traditional retrieval tasks. In this paper, however, we show that the rise of online micro document platforms, such as Twitter, has brought new relevance to the technique for finding and understanding information about recent events. Our novel approach builds on hierarchical topic clustering combined with a tree map-based visualization to provide a highly interactive information management and query sandboxing space. Large volumes of data, only accessible through rate- and throughput-limited channels, can thus effectively be filtered and retrieved using iteratively optimized queries.

Mining and exploring care pathways from electronic medical records with visual analytics,2015,2-s2.0-84938563987,"Objective: In order to derive data-driven insights, we develop Care Pathway Explorer, a system that mines and visualizes a set of frequent event sequences from patient EMR data. The goal is to utilize historical EMR data to extract common sequences of medical events such as diagnoses and treatments, and investigate how these sequences correlate with patient outcome. Materials and methods: The Care Pathway Explorer uses a frequent sequence mining algorithm adapted to handle the real-world properties of EMR data, including techniques for handling event concurrency, multiple levels-of-detail, temporal context, and outcome. The mined patterns are then visualized in an interactive user interface consisting of novel overview and flow visualizations. Results: We use the proposed system to analyze the diagnoses and treatments of a cohort of hyperlipidemic patients with hypertension and diabetes pre-conditions, and demonstrate the clinical relevance of patterns mined from EMR data. The patterns that were identified corresponded to clinical and published knowledge, some of it unknown to the physician at the time of discovery.

It is an interactive assessment method that allows a user to explore a ""space"" of known projection techniques and view their results, as well as to identify the differences between them. In addition, it generates ""on-the-fly"" new projection techniques via interpolations of existing techniques as the user explores the projection space.

Converting database on dendrological objects of kortowo campus at the University of Warmia and mazury in olsztyn to current GIS standards,2015,2-s2.0-84946401401,"The INSPIRE Directive aims to create a UE spatial data information and requires ordering of the national spatial data. To meet these obligations, not only should the new files be created but also the existing ones ought to be converted to the required standard of Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) [1]. The existing dendrological inventory database on Kortowo campus at the University of Warmia and Mazury in Olsztyn has been restructured and harmonized. The dendrological object set was created in 2008 in accordance with the previously accepted regulations. It described 7568 plant objects of which 5398 constituted single trees. While converting the available database, the requirements of INSPIRE Directive and GIS tools were implemented. The initial set was based on maps in the local coordinate system, in CAD system and descriptive data from Excel. The transformation and sets merging were performed on the basis of adopted database model. It involved graphic data conversion to a flat reference system based on WGS84 ellipsoid. The graphical data were converted into the objects of geobase and then the objects were merged with the descriptive data base from attribute tables (xlsx). Some of the stages in the experiment such as data converting, carrying out the statistical study and making the visualization revealed errors already stored in the initial base. The source data were not consistent and the transformation required onerous corrections. As a result, the university geobase of dendrological objects was established. The paper presents selected aspects of visualization, both of the initial database and the data after transformation. Available database (already historical), converted to existing standards, constitutes an interesting part of the currently built information system on academic campus; however, it has to be updated and adequately maintained. © SGEM2015.",International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference,"15th International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference and EXPO, SGEM 2015",18 June 2015 through 24 June 2015,"Lewandowicz E., Antolak M.",56646360900;56641847900;,"Lewandowicz, E., Department of Land Surveing and Geomatics, University Warmia and Mazury in Olsztyn, Poland; Antolak, M., Department of Landscape Architecture, University Warmia and Mazury in Olsztyn, Poland","International Multidisciplinary Scientific GeoConference Surveying Geology and Mining Ecology Management, SGEM","Int.

Adaptive semi-supervised recursive tree partitioning: The ART towards large scale patient indexing in personalized healthcare,2015,2-s2.0-84930742018,"With the rapid development of information technologies, tremendous amount of data became readily available in various application domains. This big data era presents challenges to many conventional data analytics research directions including data capture, storage, search, sharing, analysis, and visualization. It is no surprise to see that the success of next-generation healthcare systems heavily relies on the effective utilization of gigantic amounts of medical data. The ability of analyzing big data in modern healthcare systems plays a vital role in the improvement of the quality of care delivery.Specifically, patient similarity evaluation aims at estimating the clinical affinity and diagnostic proximity of patients. As one of the successful data driven techniques adopted in healthcare systems, patient similarity evaluation plays a fundamental role in many healthcare research areas such as prognosis, risk assessment, and comparative effectiveness analysis. However, existing algorithms for patient similarity evaluation are inefficient in handling massive patient data. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Semi-Supervised Recursive Tree Partitioning (ART) framework for large scale patient indexing such that the patients with similar clinical or diagnostic patterns can be correctly and efficiently retrieved. The framework is designed for semi-supervised settings since it is crucial to leverage experts' supervision knowledge in medical scenario, which are fairly limited compared to the available data. Starting from the proposed ART framework, we will discuss several specific instantiations and validate them on both benchmark and real world healthcare data. Our results show that with the ART framework, the patients can be efficiently and effectively indexed in the sense that (1) similarity patients can be retrieved in a very short time; (2) the retrieval performance can beat the state-of-the art indexing methods. © 2015.",Academic Press Inc.,,,Wang F.,56177292700;,"Wang, F., Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, United States",Journal of Biomedical Informatics,J.

In recent years (mid-80s and 90s of the twentieth century), single analysis of the level of water accumulation on the surface as well as comparative analysis of changes were carried out in the Central Mining Institute. The information collected at that time about overflow lands was based on data concerning the surface, depth, volume and quality of water, type of the overflow land, ground conditions, etc. obtained from mines within USCB. The possibilities of data analysis, their supplementation and spatial processing were significantly limited at that time compared to the current methods of acquisition, processing and visualization of data. At present, the measurements can be taken using satellite imaging or laser scanning and subsequently, data can be stored in GIS spatial databases and be subject to further (multidimensional 3D, 4D) spatial analysis and interpretation. In recent years, remote sensing technique of Earth surface becomes more and more attractive due to the increasing precision of devices used for registration of electromagnetic radiation (sensors) and the possibilities of their use. The sensors are installed mostly on boards of satellites that orbit the Earth. Additional factors which increase the attractiveness of satellite imaging include launching new satellite systems into orbit, which have better and better spatial, spectral and temporal resolution as well as miniaturization of such devices, which is reflected in the costs related to launching such a system into orbit. A distinguished factor is the trend of lowering the purchase prices of these imaging, compared with the purchase price some years ago which is also the result of making this technology more popular and cheaper. The author included in this paper information from literature which was also analyzed in terms of the practical use of satellite imaging in mining and environmental hydrogeology, as a modern source of obtaining data for hydrogeological analysis. After the analysis of information on remote sensing techniques means used for observation of water accumulation on the surface of areas under influence of mining operations, the author points out the types of satellite imaging which can be used for mapping the water conditions on the surface and within the subsurface area of overlay formations of deposit beds. © SGEM2015.",International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference,"15th International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference and EXPO, SGEM 2015",18 June 2015 through 24 June 2015,Kura K.,55979950300;,"Kura, K., Central Mining Institute in Katowice, Dept. of Geology and Geophysics, Poland","International Multidisciplinary Scientific GeoConference Surveying Geology and Mining Ecology Management, SGEM","Int.

Use of GIS technology in surface water monitoring for targeted policy intervention in a mountainous catchment in Romania,2015,2-s2.0-84946416084,"The collection of information on surface water quality is a specific activity that takes place systematically and regularly at regional and national scale, and it is important for the assessment of the water quality as well as for water management policy-making. A data base information management using a Geographical Information System (GIS) forms an important aspect of environmental management, which provides the frame for processing and visualisation of water monitoring data and information as well as for the optimisation of monitoring concepts. This paper presents an architecture performed by a GIS which provides a grafic database and attributes the nesessary measurements of the water quality to different sections of the mountainous catchment of the Suceava river in the north of Romania. With this approach the location of the water sampling points can be optimised in terms of the selection and setting of the river sections. To facilitate the setting of the sampling locations in the various sections of water sampling in the river, the presented GIS system provides to the user different information layers with combined or isolated data according to the objectives. In the frame of the research were created 5 layers of information in the basin under study, underlying the determination of a new information layer, namely the ""Hydrografic Network Graded to Hydrographic Sections"". Practically, in the studied basin were established 8 sections for water sampling locations, and the water quality characterization was done by the consideration of 15 quality indicators. The GIS system presented in this research is a valuable, useful and adaptable to land use changes data base that can be exploited by any number of combinations, its capabilities justify it’s role as ""tool to support decision making."" With this characteristics it supports the policy-making of the competent bodies to fulfil the requirements of EC Water Framework Directive on catchment scale and it serves as planning tool for hydroengineering and water resources management. © SGEM2015.",International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference,"15th International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference and EXPO, SGEM 2015",18 June 2015 through 24 June 2015,"Biali G., Schneider P., Cojocaru P.",55837093100;55422072200;56806755600;,"Biali, G., ”Gheorghe Asachi” Technical University of Iasi, Romania; Schneider, P., University of Applied Sciences Magdeburg-Stendal, Germany; Cojocaru, P., ”Gheorghe Asachi” Technical University of Iasi, Romania","International Multidisciplinary Scientific GeoConference Surveying Geology and Mining Ecology Management, SGEM","Int.

Study of soil loss quantity on the arable territories using estimations of soil pollutants migration and geomorphometric parameters of the microrelief,2015,2-s2.0-84946557182,"Agricultural use of the territories, which are complicated with erosional relief, makes it necessary to conduct research and monitoring of erosion processes on these territories. On the other hand, the investigations of the soil runoff character and the features of soil pollutants migration (e.g. pesticides, radionuclides of artificial origin, etc.) that associated with runoff are also necessary for the implementation of precision agriculture. The correct information concerning current and forecasted amount of soil loss and soil pollutants distribution allows organizing and carrying out the efficient land use and land recultivation. The project scope was established as the estimation of soil loss amounts in the elements of ancient and modern erosion network. Additional important task was the detection of math relations between quantitative parameters (geomorphometric parameters) of the microrelief elements (landforms with dimensions from few meters to a few tens of meters) and the amount of soil runoff. The study is based on field data, which were collected on arable slopes in the upper Oka river basin (Orel region, Russia). Study was conducted in three phases: field, cameral and analytical. Field phase included survey of positions of the stream thalwegs, leveling of the watershed surface, and soil sampling. Cameral phase included processing of the leveling and survey data, preparation of the soil samples, and visualization of the map layers in geoinformational software. Analytical phase included radiological analysis of soil samples, calculation of geomorphometric parameters and modeling of dependencies between the magnitude of the cesium-137 activity and values of some geomorphometric parameters (i.e. catchment area, profile curvature, etc.). As a result of investigations, some calculation algorithms for soil loss estimation were proposed. These algorithms describe the dependences of the cesium-137 activity with the catchment area and profile curvature (which allows to take into account the difference of the intensity of soil runoff at the concave and convex sectors of the slope). These findings make it possible to improve the accuracy of the soil loss calculation for arable slopes complicated with erosional landforms at the region of research. © SGEM2015.",International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference,"15th International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference and EXPO, SGEM 2015",18 June 2015 through 24 June 2015,"Trofimetz L., Panidi E.",56951300100;16310478900;,"Trofimetz, L., Orel State University, Department of Geography, Russian Federation; Panidi, E., Saint-Petersburg State University, Institute of Earth Sciences, Department of Cartography and Geoinformatics, Russian Federation","International Multidisciplinary Scientific GeoConference Surveying Geology and Mining Ecology Management, SGEM","Int.

How to improve robustness in Kohonen maps and display additional information in Factorial Analysis: Application to text mining,2015,2-s2.0-85027932597,"This article is an extended version of a paper presented in the WSOM'2012 conference (Bourgeois et al., 2012 [1]). We display a combination of factorial projections, SOM algorithm and graph techniques applied to a text mining problem. The corpus contains eight medieval manuscripts which were used to teach arithmetic techniques to merchants.Among the techniques for Data Analysis, those used for Lexicometry (such as Factorial Analysis) highlight the discrepancies between manuscripts. The reason for this is that they focus on the deviation from the independence between words and manuscripts. Still, we also want to discover and characterize the common vocabulary among the whole corpus.Using the properties of stochastic Kohonen maps, which define neighborhood between inputs in a non-deterministic way, we highlight the words which seem to play a special role in the vocabulary. We call them fickle and use them to improve both Kohonen map robustness and significance of FCA visualization. Finally we use graph algorithmic to exploit this fickleness for classification of words. © 2014.",Elsevier B.V.,,,"Bourgeois N., Cottrell M., Déruelle B., Lamassé S., Letrémy P.",24337615300;56277529100;57214053359;55553749800;7801591882;,"Bourgeois, N., SAMM - Université Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne 90, rue de Tolbiac, Paris, 75013, France; Cottrell, M., SAMM - Université Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne 90, rue de Tolbiac, Paris, 75013, France; Déruelle, B., PIREH-LAMOP - Université Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne 1, rue Victor Cousin, Paris, France; Lamassé, S., PIREH-LAMOP - Université Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne 1, rue Victor Cousin, Paris, France; Letrémy, P., SAMM - Université Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne 90, rue de Tolbiac, Paris, 75013, France",Neurocomputing,Neurocomputing,11.0

Automatic generation of 3D building models by building polygons orthogonalization,2015,2-s2.0-84969199650,"A 3D city model is important in urban planning and game industries. But, enormous time and labor has to be consumed to create these 3D models. In order to automate laborious steps, a GIS (Geographic Information System) and CG integrated system is proposed for automatically generating 3D building models, based on building polygons on a digital map. Since technicians are drawing these polygons manually with digitizers, depending on aerial photos, not all building polygons are precisely orthogonal. However, creating 3D building models are expected to be orthogonal. When placing a set of boxes as building bodies for creating the buildings, there may be gaps or overlaps between these boxes if building polygons are not precisely orthogonal. In this paper, the new methodology is proposed for rectifying and orthogonalizing the shape of building polygons and generating 3D building models without any gap and overlap.",IADIS,"International Conferences on Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction 2015, IHCI 2015, Game and Entertainment Technologies 2015, GET 2015 and Computer Graphics, Visualization, Computer Vision and Image Processing 2015, CGVCVIP 2015 - Part of the Multi Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems 2015",22 July 2015 through 24 July 2015,"Sugihara K., Shen Z.-J.",35397544400;55219953800;,"Sugihara, K., Gifu Keizai University, 5-50 Kitagata-chou, Ogaki-city Gifu-Pref, 503-8550, Japan; Shen, Z.-J., Kanazawa University, Kakuma-chou Kanazawa-city Ishikawa-Pref, 920-1192, Japan","Proceedings of the International Conferences on Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction 2015, IHCI 2015, Game and Entertainment Technologies 2015, GET 2015 and Computer Graphics, Visualization, Computer Vision and Image Processing 2015, CGVCVIP 2015 - Part of the Multi Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems 2015","Proc.

GIS tools for the evaluation of the sigma and beta convergence trends in Eastern Europe between 2001-2011,2015,2-s2.0-84946397689,"This paper investigates the role played by the territorial endowment in the dynamics of the GDP growth for the 2001-2011 period, at NUTS3 scale. Using a GIS approach of the geo-spatial data management and algorithms of classification, we present the steps needed for the elaboration of GIS tools that evaluate locally and globally, both the trends of sigma and beta economic convergence. These tools are mobilized to better understand how the NUTS3 from Eastern Europe behave in three different periods: before the economic crisis, during the financial distress and in the recent years of economic recovery. The first tool enables the evaluation of the beta-convergence, using a Gaussian kernel to weight the territorial data. The second GIS model we propose in this paper maps the sigma-convergence trends in the evolution of the NUTS3 GDP. Different approaches of the sigma convergence trends are possible, but few of them take into account the role played by the territorial belonging of the spatial units that one will analyze. The third and the final GIS model we describe in this article synthesize the results obtained previously (beta and sigma convergence analysis). This last tool is more oriented to the data visualization, in a friendly user way. The article presents the logical steps needed for the analysis of a challenging topic like the economic convergence.

However, extrapolating site-scale observations to regional scales represents a major challenge confronting the agricultural modeling community. This study introduces a novel geospatial agricultural modeling system (GAMS) exploring the integration of the mechanistic Environmental Policy Integrated Climate model, spatially-resolved data, surveyed management data, and supercomputing functions for cropland C budgets estimates. This modeling system creates spatially-explicit modeling units at a spatial resolution consistent with remotely-sensed crop identification and assigns cropping systems to each of them by geo-referencing surveyed crop management information at the county or state level. A parallel computing algorithm was also developed to facilitate the computationally intensive model runs and output post-processing and visualization. We evaluated GAMS against National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) reported crop yields and inventory estimated county-scale cropland C budgets averaged over 2000-2008. We observed good overall agreement, with spatial correlation of 0.89, 0.90, 0.41, and 0.87, for crop yields, Net Primary Production (NPP), Soil Organic C (SOC) change, and Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE), respectively. However, we also detected notable differences in the magnitude of NPP and NEE, as well as in the spatial pattern of SOC change. By performing crop-specific annual comparisons, we discuss possible explanations for the discrepancies between GAMS and the inventory method, such as data requirements, representation of agroecosystem processes, completeness and accuracy of crop management data, and accuracy of crop area representation. Based on these analyses, we further discuss strategies to improve GAMS by updating input data and by designing more efficient parallel computing capability to quantitatively assess errors associated with the simulation of C budget components. The modularized design of the GAMS makes it flexible to be updated and adapted for different agricultural models so long as they require similar input data, and to be linked with socio-economic models to understand the effectiveness and implications of diverse C management practices and policies. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Elsevier Ltd,,,"Zhang X., Izaurralde R.C., Manowitz D.H., Sahajpal R., West T.O., Thomson A.M., Xu M., Zhao K., LeDuc S.D., Williams J.R.",55715512300;7004672812;23566820600;7801617087;7202352390;7403717763;56042086800;7202071824;18437347800;7409577754;,"Zhang, X., Joint Global Change Research Institute, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and University of Maryland, College Park, MD  20740, United States; Izaurralde, R.C., Department of Geographical Sciences, University of Maryland, College Park, MD  20742, United States, Texas AandM AgriLife Research and Extension Center, 720 E.

Between the virtual and the physical: Mental-emotional experiences of space in digital games and virtual worlds,2015,2-s2.0-84969268595,"In the computer-based experience of space in digital games, along with the physical and the virtual, a third space is emerging, which this paper suggests to be a hybrid mental-emotional space. This paper will focus on this hybrid space from the point of view of art. This research addresses the question of how a change at interface level transforms the mental-emotional experience of space in video games and virtual worlds. The thesis is that from specific changes made at this level, different mental-emotional experiences of space in video games could in fact be generated. The aim is to analyze how these changes that are being made at interface level in the art field impact the spatial experience. In order to achieve this aim, firstly, a conceptual framework will be developed regarding the different ways interaction emerges in the mental-emotional space; secondly, an analytical model for space involvement will be proposed. Lastly, a case study will be analyzed and some conclusions offered. This paper will contribute to the definition of the features of this mental-emotional space and to the analysis of the new possibilities for experiencing space in digital games and virtual worlds.",IADIS,"International Conferences on Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction 2015, IHCI 2015, Game and Entertainment Technologies 2015, GET 2015 and Computer Graphics, Visualization, Computer Vision and Image Processing 2015, CGVCVIP 2015 - Part of the Multi Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems 2015",22 July 2015 through 24 July 2015,Gallastegui S.,57189322711;,"Gallastegui, S., University of the Basque Country, Spain","Proceedings of the International Conferences on Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction 2015, IHCI 2015, Game and Entertainment Technologies 2015, GET 2015 and Computer Graphics, Visualization, Computer Vision and Image Processing 2015, CGVCVIP 2015 - Part of the Multi Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems 2015","Proc.

Simulation of low-vision experience by using a head-mounted virtual reality system,2015,2-s2.0-84969260656,"In this study, a system for simulating low-vision experience was developed by using immersive virtual reality technology. The proposed system consisted of a wide-view head-mounted display and an eye tracker that could modify the display in concert with real-time fixation patterns to restrict an arbitrary area of the human visual field. We conducted an experiment to evaluate the validity of the proposed system. Subjects were asked to walk through a small maze under two visual conditions in which 10 degrees of their central visual field was restricted artificially with black circles using the proposed system. Under one of the visual conditions, the restriction moved synchronously with the subjects' eye movement so that the 10 degrees of the central fovea was always restricted despite eye movement; on the other hand, under the other condition, the restriction could not move. The experiment results indicated that the time for walking through the entire maze under the visual condition with 10 degrees of the central visual field restricted in synchronization with eye movement was longer than that under the condition in which 10 degrees of the fixed central area of the screen were restricted. Further, the amplitude of the walking trajectory on a straight pass under the visual condition with 10 degrees of the central visual field restricted in synchronization with eye movement was higher than that under the condition in which 10 degrees of the fixed central area of the screen was restricted. The influence of the eye-following movement of the restricting black circles and the validity of the proposed system were investigated.",IADIS,"International Conferences on Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction 2015, IHCI 2015, Game and Entertainment Technologies 2015, GET 2015 and Computer Graphics, Visualization, Computer Vision and Image Processing 2015, CGVCVIP 2015 - Part of the Multi Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems 2015",22 July 2015 through 24 July 2015,Yoshioka Y.,55565140600;,"Yoshioka, Y., Chiba University (Japan), Department of Architecture, 1-33, Yayoi-cho, Inage-ku, Chiba, Japan","Proceedings of the International Conferences on Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction 2015, IHCI 2015, Game and Entertainment Technologies 2015, GET 2015 and Computer Graphics, Visualization, Computer Vision and Image Processing 2015, CGVCVIP 2015 - Part of the Multi Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems 2015","Proc.

Towards an updated typology of non-player character roles,2015,2-s2.0-84969257735,"In video games, non-player characters (NPCs) provide important services in that they facilitate the player's interaction with the game in a way that is in accordance with the expectations set by the narrative. It is, however, still unclear in what ways these NPCs must act, look, and feel in order to fulfill these expectations. In this study we aim to establish a typology of the roles NPCs play in games, building on a previous typology by Bartle (2004) aimed at providing a framework for describing the requirements put on NPCs by these expectations. This was done via an online survey, where respondents were asked to classify NPCs in images from 4 games, and to provide a description of why they classified it as belonging to a certain role. The results of the survey were the analyzed for instances where players expressed confusion about which role an NPC belonged to. These findings were used to update the previous typology. The results from this were later verified by applying the new typology to 10 other games. In the end we identified a number of new roles, as well as modifications to existing roles, which when combined with Bartle's original typology created a typology applicable to a larger number of genres.",IADIS,"International Conferences on Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction 2015, IHCI 2015, Game and Entertainment Technologies 2015, GET 2015 and Computer Graphics, Visualization, Computer Vision and Image Processing 2015, CGVCVIP 2015 - Part of the Multi Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems 2015",22 July 2015 through 24 July 2015,"Warpefelt H., Verhagen H.",56039511000;7005218096;,"Warpefelt, H., Department of Computer and Systems Sciences, Stockholm University, Borgarfjordsgatan 12, Kista, SE-16407, Sweden; Verhagen, H., Department of Computer and Systems Sciences, Stockholm University, Borgarfjordsgatan 12, Kista, SE-16407, Sweden","Proceedings of the International Conferences on Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction 2015, IHCI 2015, Game and Entertainment Technologies 2015, GET 2015 and Computer Graphics, Visualization, Computer Vision and Image Processing 2015, CGVCVIP 2015 - Part of the Multi Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems 2015","Proc.

Usability evaluation on a new window operation interface by finger gesture above a keyboard,2015,2-s2.0-84969249014,"There are many situations when users operate multiple windows simultaneously on a computer, such as looking at web browsers while making documents or searching program codes while writing programs. Generally, users can use a mouse or keyboard to change the focus among windows. However, when users frequently switch between typing and operating a mouse, they can be annoyed by having to move to shift devices, such as releasing a hand from the home position of a keyboard for mouse operation. In this paper, we propose an interface to reduce workload by enabling users to operate inactive windows when switching between typing and pointing. The interface recognizes hand gestures by using a depth sensor that images a keyboard entirely and uses the hand gestures for window operation. We implemented a prototype, evaluated task workload, and compared operation time of the proposed interface with mouse operation when typing and pointing are frequently switched between.

Our obtained results are promising: geometric complexity is vastly reduced while maintaining a recognizable model, unlike results with classical simplification approaches as employed by commercial applications.

Multi-boundary shape retrieval based on a new class of moment functions,2015,2-s2.0-84969188107,"Based on a class of complete orthogonal function system, V-system, this paper proposes a new kind of moment functions (called V-moment functions), and applies them to the shape retrieval. The V-moments are orthogonal, and involve only simple linear operations. The V-moments can be used to extract image features accurately, and the original image can be reconstructed with only a small amount of them. The V-moments have advantage in extracting features of image with complex boundaries since the V-system contains a great deal of discontinuous basis functions. Therefore, feature extraction of multi-boundary image using V-moments is very promising. This paper performs image retrieval based on their shape features. The results of retrieval experiment, conducted on benchmark database MPEG-7-shape-CE2, show that the algorithm proposed in this paper outperforms some classical moments including Zernike moments, Hu invariant moments, orthogonal Fourier-Mellin moments, Legendre moments and the geometric central moments in retrieval efficiency according to several evaluation indexes.",IADIS,"International Conferences on Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction 2015, IHCI 2015, Game and Entertainment Technologies 2015, GET 2015 and Computer Graphics, Visualization, Computer Vision and Image Processing 2015, CGVCVIP 2015 - Part of the Multi Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems 2015",22 July 2015 through 24 July 2015,"Song R., Wang X., Wang Y., Gu M.",12806905400;35868245800;56431256000;57202891953;,"Song, R., College of Sciences, North China University of Technology, Beijing, 100144, China; Wang, X., College of Sciences, Beijing Forestry University, Beijing, 100083, China; Wang, Y., College of Sciences, North China University of Technology, Beijing, 100144, China; Gu, M., College of Sciences, North China University of Technology, Beijing, 100144, China","Proceedings of the International Conferences on Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction 2015, IHCI 2015, Game and Entertainment Technologies 2015, GET 2015 and Computer Graphics, Visualization, Computer Vision and Image Processing 2015, CGVCVIP 2015 - Part of the Multi Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems 2015","Proc.

At the same time, sighted players should perceive the game as a regular game. This paper presents an evaluation of the game where the player immersion has been evaluated through a post test immersion questionnaire. The study was conducted with three independent groups: sighted players using graphics (n=10), blindfolded sighted players (n=10) and visually impaired players (n=9). Although progress in the game and the reported sense of control differed between groups, player immersion was very high in all groups.

Graph search effort is reduced proportional to the number of agents with similar nearby destinations, while the unique navigational behavior of each individual agent remains unchanged and intact.

Image block compressed sensing under low sampling-ratio,2015,2-s2.0-84969157719,"Block Compressed Sensing (BCS) is a new image sampling/compressing method with compressed sensing (CS). To solve the performance degradation of BCS-SPL (BCS with Smoothed Projected Landweber algorithm) at low sampling-ratio, we propose a novel algorithm called Total Variation based Adaptive-Sampling BCS with OMP (TVAS-BCS-OMP). TVAS-BCS-OMP blocks the whole image in an overlapping way to eliminate blocking effect. It assigns sampling-ratio depending on each block' texture complexity, which is measured by the block's Total Variation (TV) so that the blocks with big TV can attain higher sampling-ratio. Then only limited nonzero coefficients in each block are retained according to the adaptively assigned sampling-ratio. At last, we sample the blocks and conducts OMP reconstruction respectively. The experimental results show that under the condition of low initial sampling-ratio (lower than 0.2), TVAS-BCS-OMP achieves better reconstruction precision than BCS-SPL, especially in the blocks with complex texture.

Developing of evaluation method of motion repeatability by motion capturing,2015,2-s2.0-84969142014,"Motion repeatability is one of the required skills for any sports including tennis. One of the reasons why expert tennis players can accurately serve the ball to another side is their motion repeatability. On the other hand, however the novice players can luckily serve the ball, they are required to practice again and again to repeat the motion. The reliable criterion by the objective numerical indicator is needed for training and evaluation of motion repeatability. In this study, the method of numerical evaluation of motion repeatability would be developed by a motion capture system. The correlation coefficients of each segment angular fluctuation on the serving motions were validated as the criterion for motion repeatability. 17 sensors measure three-dimensional 23 segments and 22 joints angle fluctuations during the two seconds around the ball impact. Three experienced tennis players and three novice players tried to serve ten balls by right arms. The results of the experiments indicated that the repeatability of upper body tends to be stable comparing arms and legs for all the subjects. The correlation coefficients of the fluctuations at the measurement joints that are far from the upper body tend to be low. Comparing the experts and the novices on the motion of the arms and legs, the novices have much variation of correlation coefficients of each motion than the experts. In addition, most of the motion fluctuations of novices are larger than those of the experts. This study revealed that the joint angular fluctuation would be able to be applied as a criterion of motion repeatability.",IADIS,"International Conferences on Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction 2015, IHCI 2015, Game and Entertainment Technologies 2015, GET 2015 and Computer Graphics, Visualization, Computer Vision and Image Processing 2015, CGVCVIP 2015 - Part of the Multi Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems 2015",22 July 2015 through 24 July 2015,"Kato M., Sato T., Shimodaira Y.",56563366200;55702775400;55337879300;,"Kato, M., Waseda University, 279-15 Mikajima 2, Tokorozawa Saitama, 359-1192, Japan; Sato, T., Jissen Women's University, 1-1 Osakaue 4, Hino Tokyo, 191-8510, Japan; Shimodaira, Y., Nagano Prefectural College, 49-7 Miwa 8, Nagano, 380-8525, Japan","Proceedings of the International Conferences on Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction 2015, IHCI 2015, Game and Entertainment Technologies 2015, GET 2015 and Computer Graphics, Visualization, Computer Vision and Image Processing 2015, CGVCVIP 2015 - Part of the Multi Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems 2015","Proc.

Rock fall simulation using 3D models reconstructed from multiple-view images,2015,2-s2.0-84969141847,"This paper proposes a method of rock fall simulation using physics engine and 3D models reconstructed by Image-Based Modeling technique. The shape of rocks is important to estimate the accurate way of leap and route of falling motion in 3D simulation. However, in most current researches, although the 3D model of slope is well accurately scanned using a laser scanner, it is not sufficient to estimate the complex behavior of falling rocks due to modeling the shape of rocks is too simple such as sphere or cube. Our proposed method generates 3D models in more accurate shape using Image-Based Modeling technique. The estimated scales are precisely reconstructed as compared with the real measured ones.

Towards ludoacoustic immersion perspectives on transcending the virtual and the real of functional sound and music in interactive media,2015,2-s2.0-84969135584,"Regardless of listening to a small studio or to a huge cathedral, the environment in which sound and music is performed can act as an agent of meaning in how we relate to our actual surroundings. Applying a short reverb on a love song may point at a setting of upfront intimacy and accessibility. On the other hand, situating that song within the blurry inaccessible spaciousness of a cathedral may not improve your chances to make your date stay past dessert. In both cases expressive compatibility of room acoustics is determined on expectations generated from the music material: But does the environment as well as its functional setting in user interaction also arouse expectations towards the expressive properties of sound/music? And how might these properties affect selective attention, the sense of immersion/presence and finally the decoding of semiotic agents in the music dramaturgy of an interactive environment? In recorded sound-fx and music, expressive artifacts of space contribute to forming expectations on how an object [sound source] is interacting with an environment [room] while also accounting for the associated resonances occurring in that object. By switching attentional focus between action and resonance in object and environment as a result of comparing expectations to incoming stimuli, the context of a virtual situation is simulated by referencing to a syntax on body-object-environment interaction. This virtual syntax may be partially projected onto the situational context of the recipient leading to antecedents of immersion depending on emotional arousal and personality traits such as empathising-systemising. After having outlined a conceptual framework describing the mediation and agency detection of sonic expression within the acoustic properties of situational contexts, the last part of the paper shall provide an outlook on how these agents may be translated to meaningful structures that are yet to be studied in interactive media such as video games.",IADIS,"International Conferences on Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction 2015, IHCI 2015, Game and Entertainment Technologies 2015, GET 2015 and Computer Graphics, Visualization, Computer Vision and Image Processing 2015, CGVCVIP 2015 - Part of the Multi Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems 2015",22 July 2015 through 24 July 2015,Gasselseder H.-P.,56287770500;,"Gasselseder, H.-P., Aalborg University, Department of Communication and Psychology, Musikkens Plads 1, Aalborg, 9000, Denmark","Proceedings of the International Conferences on Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction 2015, IHCI 2015, Game and Entertainment Technologies 2015, GET 2015 and Computer Graphics, Visualization, Computer Vision and Image Processing 2015, CGVCVIP 2015 - Part of the Multi Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems 2015","Proc.

Extracting pupil contour with hough transform of connected component boundaries,2015,2-s2.0-84969135560,"A method for determining the pupil boundary in the image of eye is proposed. The method is based on examining connected components of binarized image. The components are first sorted according to probability to contain pupil, which is estimated from their inertia moments by empirically derived rules. Hough transform is applied to border of the component and outlines the center of most pronounced circular arc. If center hypothesis is strong enough the histogram of distances of border points to this center is built. If pronounced maximum exists on the histogram it means that a circle or an arc is present in this component, which is taken for pupil boundary.

Static and dynamic object reconstruction using phase shifting of De Bruijn pattern,2015,2-s2.0-84969135482,A novel structured light method for color 3D surface profilometry is proposed. The proposed method may be used for reconstruction of both static and moving objects and does not require accurate color calibration of a camera-projector pair. The method is based on a structured light pattern that is a combination of a De Bruijn color sequence and of a sinusoidal fringe pattern. For static scenes phase-shifting and the De Bruijn window property are combined to obtain a high accuracy reconstruction. For dynamic scenes the Hessian ridge detector is applied to find stripes whose colors are decoded using a Gaussian mixture model. The De Bruijn window property and dynamic programming then uniquely identify projected stripes yielding a spatially sparser reconstruction. We have tested the proposed method on multiple objects with challenging surfaces and different albedos that clearly demonstrate both usability and robustness.,IADIS,"International Conferences on Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction 2015, IHCI 2015, Game and Entertainment Technologies 2015, GET 2015 and Computer Graphics, Visualization, Computer Vision and Image Processing 2015, CGVCVIP 2015 - Part of the Multi Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems 2015",22 July 2015 through 24 July 2015,"Donlic M., Petkovic T., Pribanic T.",57189328550;57197169427;6507860290;,"Donlic, M., University of Zagreb, Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, Unska 3, Zagreb, HR-10000, Croatia; Petkovic, T., University of Zagreb, Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, Unska 3, Zagreb, HR-10000, Croatia; Pribanic, T., University of Zagreb, Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, Unska 3, Zagreb, HR-10000, Croatia","Proceedings of the International Conferences on Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction 2015, IHCI 2015, Game and Entertainment Technologies 2015, GET 2015 and Computer Graphics, Visualization, Computer Vision and Image Processing 2015, CGVCVIP 2015 - Part of the Multi Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems 2015","Proc.

Interactive feature space extension for multidimensional data projection,2015,2-s2.0-84922679538,"Projecting multi-dimensional data to a lower-dimensional visual display is a commonly used approach for identifying and analyzing patterns in data. Many dimensionality reduction techniques exist for generating visual embeddings, but it is often hard to avoid cluttered projections when the data is large in size and noisy. For many application users who are not machine learning experts, it is difficult to control the process in order to improve the ""readability"" of the projection and at the same time to understand their quality. In this paper, we propose a simple interactive feature transformation approach that allows the analyst to de-clutter the visualization by gradually transforming the original feature space based on existing class knowledge. By changing a single parameter, the user can easily decide the desired trade-off between structural preservation and the visual quality during the transforming process. The proposed approach integrates semi-interactive feature transformation techniques as well as a variety of quality measures to help analysts generate uncluttered projections and understand their quality. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",Elsevier,,,"Pérez D., Zhang L., Schaefer M., Schreck T., Keim D., Díaz I.",56686236600;55192325900;34880664000;8626331600;34769953100;35974383400;,"Pérez, D., Área de Ingeniería de Sistemas y Automática, University of Oviedo, Spain; Zhang, L., Interaction Design Centre, Middlesex University, United Kingdom; Schaefer, M., Data Analysis and Visualization Group, University of Konstanz, Germany; Schreck, T., Data Analysis and Visualization Group, University of Konstanz, Germany; Keim, D., Data Analysis and Visualization Group, University of Konstanz, Germany; Díaz, I., Área de Ingeniería de Sistemas y Automática, University of Oviedo, Spain",Neurocomputing,Neurocomputing,8.0

Inaccurate information perceived from digital cartographic representation may not be caused due to incorrect way of interpreting, but are often already caused by some inaccuracy in the data collection (e.g. precision measurements of position) and their subsequent processing (e.g. different ways of data interpolation). When such processed information represents a basis for decision-making processes, the quality of subsequent decisions is determined by the quality and accuracy of user information perception. In many areas of decision making there are used geovisualisations (cartographic visualizations), which are interpreted by experts on various topics, not only by cartographers or data specialist. Such cases include, for example, administration, crisis management and many other fields of human activity. In surfaces visualizations there are usually used the standard expression cartographic methods, such as contour lines, a method of colour hypsometry or pseudo-3D previews. The visualized surface is mostly presented as precise and standard representation do not present any vagueness, so the user does not know the accuracy in which information can be count and whether this degree of inaccuracy is constant or variable in the study area. The solution of this disadvantageous situation is the visualization of fuzzy surfaces, which includes not only information about the altitude, but also the uncertainty. The paper describes the visualization of fuzzy data in order to make the most efficient transfer of information from the map to the user. There are presented the results of research focused on the user aspects of fuzzy visualization of surfaces using the latest approaches in the cartography. © SGEM2014.",International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference,"14th International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference and EXPO, SGEM 2014",17 June 2014 through 26 June 2014,"Vondráková A., Caha J.",55387971400;55388125800;,"Vondráková, A., Department of Geoinformatics, Palacký University, Olomouc, Czech Republic; Caha, J., Department of Geoinformatics, Palacký University, Olomouc, Czech Republic","International Multidisciplinary Scientific GeoConference Surveying Geology and Mining Ecology Management, SGEM","Int.

Visualization of oceanographic applications using a common data model,2014,2-s2.0-84905654031,"Due to the rapid development of ocean observation technology, the volume of ocean data is increasing exponent ially. To better utilize these data, more and more computational methods have been applied to exploring, sharing, and processing such data. Although great efforts have been made, there is an urgent need for a single platform containing a set of visualization components for every kind of ocean data. This paper presents a distributed, scalable and service-oriented visualization platform. The development of the platform is based on a common data model, by which ocean data with differents patial and temporal distribution can be organized and accessed in a uniform fashion, which sets a solid foundation for designing and implementing all kinds of visualization comp onents and facilit ates collaborative oceanographic research. The platform is run in China Ocean Observation System (COOS), and enables easy and convenient development of all kinds of visualization components for professionals and the general public and greatly advances ocean data sharing and scientific research collaboration.

Time-space visualisation of Amur river channel changes due to flooding disaster,2014,2-s2.0-84946749801,"The analysis of flooding levels is a highly complex temporal and spatial assessment task that involves estimation of distances between references in geographical space as well as estimations of instances along the time-line that coincide with given spatial locations. This work has an aim to interactively explore changes of Amur River boundaries caused by the severe flooding in September 2013. In our analysis of river bank changes we use satellite imagery (Landsat 7) to extract parts belonging to Amur River. We use imagery from that covers time interval July 2003 until February 2014. Image data is pre-processed using low level image processing techniques prior to visualization. Pre-processing has a purpose to extract information about the boundaries of the river, and to transform it into a vectorized format, suitable as inputs subsequent visualization. We develop visualization tools to explore the spatial and temporal relationship in the change of river banks. In particular the visualization shall allow for exploring specific geographic locations and their proximity to the river/floods at arbitrary times. We propose a time space visualization that emanates from edge detection, morphological operations and boundary statistics on Landsat 2D imagery in order to extract the borders of Amur River. For the visualization we use the time-spacecube metaphor. It is based on a 3D rectilinear context, where the 2D geographical coordinate system is extended with a time-axis pointing along the 3rd Cartesian axis. Such visualization facilitates analysis of the channel shape of Amur River and thus enabling for a conclusion regarding the defined problem. As a result we demonstrate our time-space visualization for river Amur and using some amount of geographical point data as a reference we suggest an adequate method of interpolation or imputation that can be employed to estimate value at a given location and time. © SGEM2014.",International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference,"14th International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference and EXPO, SGEM 2014",17 June 2014 through 26 June 2014,"Åhlén J., Seipel S.",8876233400;14632811800;,"Åhlén, J., University of Gävle-Department of Industrial Development, IT and Land Management, Sweden; Seipel, S., University of Gävle-Department of Industrial Development, IT and Land Management, Sweden","International Multidisciplinary Scientific GeoConference Surveying Geology and Mining Ecology Management, SGEM","Int.

Visual network analysis of twitter data for co-organizing conferences: Case CMAD 2013,2014,2-s2.0-84902296089,"The aim of this research is to explore what kinds of insights information visualization of social media data can provide for co-organizing conferences. Our paper focuses on Twitter use before, during and after conference. We present a case study based on an conference of Community Manager Appreciation Day (CMAD 2013). With the process of data-driven visual network analysis, we used Twitter data to analyse the network of conference participants and the conference's discussion topics. We were able to identify e.g. influential conference participants, most interesting presentations and discussions, similarities between interests of the conference participants. Hence, several development and information needs of conference co-organization were derived from the information visualizations, which have implications for improving the planning and co-organizing of conferences, as well as for Twitter use in conference communication. © 2014 IEEE.",IEEE Computer Society,"47th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, HICSS 2014",6 January 2014 through 9 January 2014,"Jussila J., Huhtamäki J., Henttonen K., Kärkkäinen H., Still K.",37011104900;35484079200;24777795500;6603075075;8419641700;,"Jussila, J., Tampere University of Technology, Finland; Huhtamäki, J., Tampere University of Technology, Finland; Henttonen, K., Lappeenranta University of Technology, Finland; Kärkkäinen, H., Tampere University of Technology, Finland; Still, K., VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland, Finland",Proceedings of the Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences,Proc.

Data model for multidimensional geological subsurface data in geographic information system,2014,2-s2.0-84946717269,"This paper deals with the status of development in the field of creation of digital geological subsurface models and their storage within enterprise databases. Focus is put on software used for creating the models, on data management, and the level of automation of the modeling. Solutions of several geological survey organizations (GSOs) and the latest advances in the research of this topic within the Czech Geological Survey are compared. The main source of information about subsurface geology in the Czech Republic is the database of boreholes and their logs. Other data sources include traditional 2D geological maps, geological cross-sections, geophysical measurements and interpretations, and results of previous research projects (usually in the form of isolines or grids). Topographical base maps are also used, especially the elevation information in the form of digital elevation model or grid of elevation points. All these sources of information have to be included in the data model. Most of the mentioned GSOs have been developing their multidimensional models for many years and have come up with their own software solution or a combination of commercial software packages to meet up their needs regarding the purpose of the model, modeling method, scale, requirements for interactive use, visualization etc. The enterprise Geographic Information System (GIS) of the Czech Geological Survey is built upon Esri technologies, therefore our aim is to use this technology for multidimensional data and easily combine them with 2D geoscientific data in the GIS environment. We are testing the possibility to use the extensions to ArcGIS Desktop for these purposes, especially the 3D Analyst and the ArcHydroGroundwater extensions. The Czech Geological Survey is so far producing regional or local 3D models of subsurface geology, but not in a standardized way and with unified data structure. Our aim is to produce regional to national models with the 3D layer-based approach that would be based on central data administration and that could be further improved or differentiated by a set of attributes or parameters for different applications (groundwater deposits assessment, CO2 storage, etc.). © SGEM2014.",International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference,"14th International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference and EXPO, SGEM 2014",17 June 2014 through 26 June 2014,Kondrová L.,37005592600;,"Kondrová, L., Czech Technical University in Prague, Czech Republic, Czech Geological Survey, Czech Republic","International Multidisciplinary Scientific GeoConference Surveying Geology and Mining Ecology Management, SGEM","Int.

Studying animation for real-time visual analytics: A design study of social media analytics in emergency management,2014,2-s2.0-84902295464,"Domains such as emergency management have a need for real-time change monitoring and pattern analysis, but interface design principles for real-time visual analysis situations are still under development. In this paper, we present early results from a design study in social media visual analytics for emergency management. Our motivation is a main information visualization challenge: the lack of clear design principles informed by research in human cognition for the use of animation in real-time streams. We discuss three domain-specific challenges: (1) Coping with the high volume of social media data that is generated during disaster response, (2) analysts' need to quickly extract relevant features for real-time sense-making; and (3) the effective analysis of social media streams even when some critical attributes are absent.

Word cloud explorer: Text analytics based on word clouds,2014,2-s2.0-84902272833,"Word clouds have emerged as a straightforward and visually appealing visualization method for text. They are used in various contexts as a means to provide an overview by distilling text down to those words that appear with highest frequency. Typically, this is done in a static way as pure text summarization. We think, however, that there is a larger potential to this simple yet powerful visualization paradigm in text analytics. In this work, we explore the usefulness of word clouds for general text analysis tasks. We developed a prototypical system called the Word Cloud Explorer that relies entirely on word clouds as a visualization method. It equips them with advanced natural language processing, sophisticated interaction techniques, and context information. We show how this approach can be effectively used to solve text analysis tasks and evaluate it in a qualitative user study. © 2014 IEEE.",IEEE Computer Society,"47th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, HICSS 2014",6 January 2014 through 9 January 2014,"Heimerl F., Lohmann S., Lange S., Ertl T.",12781821100;23397425600;56202661700;7004765655;,"Heimerl, F., Institute for Visualization and Interactive Systems (VIS), University of Stuttgart, Germany; Lohmann, S., Institute for Visualization and Interactive Systems (VIS), University of Stuttgart, Germany; Lange, S., Institute for Visualization and Interactive Systems (VIS), University of Stuttgart, Germany; Ertl, T., Institute for Visualization and Interactive Systems (VIS), University of Stuttgart, Germany",Proceedings of the Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences,Proc.

Knowledge-assisted BIM-based visual analytics for failure root cause detection in facilities management,2014,2-s2.0-84897450439,"Facilities managers need to identify failure cause-effect patterns in order to prepare corrective and preventive maintenance plans. This task is difficult because of the complex interaction and interdependencies between different building components. Standardization based on Building Information Modeling (BIM) provides new opportunities to improve the efficiency of facilities management (FM) operations by sharing and exchanging building information between different applications throughout the lifecycle of the facilities. This paper aims to utilize BIM visualization capabilities to provide FM technicians with visualizations that allow them to utilize their cognitive and perceptual reasoning for problem solving. It investigates a knowledge-assisted BIM-based visual analytics approach for failure root-cause detection in FM. For this purpose, the inspection and maintenance data of Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS) are integrated with a BIM. Moreover, various sources of building knowledge such as fault trees and relationships between components are formally represented.

Concept of a geographic information system for the purposes of spatial planning of degraded areas,2014,2-s2.0-84946741558,"The negative phenomenon of urban sprawl of metropolitan cities at the cost of agricultural and environmentally valuable areas has been observed for many years. One of the methods of counteracting the phenomenon is directing the city’s development to the inside by using areas potentially attractive in terms of location, with expired current management function. These are predominantly industrial areas, frequently distinguished by a substantial degree of degradation. Their revitalisation, often preceded by necessary land reclamation, is a time-consuming and interdisciplinary process requiring undertaking complex and planned activities depending on particular characteristics of a given area. Decisions regarding related activities are based on obtained spatial and descriptive data. The development of information technologies, particularly including GIS software, provides vast possibilities of data processing, analysis, and visualisation. Even the most advanced analyses, however, will not bring proper results if the input data are not credible, complete, valid, and properly organised in a spatial data base. This is particularly important in the spatial management planning of industrial areas, where wrong decisions can lead to irreversible effects harmful for the environment and health of people. The article presents a concept of a Geographic Information System designed to support the process of effective spatial planning and spatial management, with particular consideration of degraded and industrial areas. The concept includes a description of necessary source data, their assessment in terms of completeness, credibility, validity, and availability, a proposal of the manner of data organisation in a spatial data base, and example models of spatial analyses. The developed Geographic Information System and models of spatial analyses constitute a tool supporting the process of programming of urban policy, investment activities, seeking of optimal planistic solutions, and identification of potential conflicts in a given area subject to a substantial degree of degradation.

Smart Compass-Clinometer: A smartphone application for easy and rapid geological site investigation,2013,2-s2.0-84882989814,"This study presents a smartphone application for geological site investigation. The application allows a smartphone to replace a diverse array of instrumentation and processes required for data measurement, visualization, and analysis. This application, named Smart Compass-Clinometer, consists of a digital compass-clinometer module, a data visualization module, a data analysis module, and a data management module. The compass-clinometer module measures the orientation of geological structures using data collected from built-in sensors. It converts the sensor data to orientation information using an algorithm developed specifically for this purpose. The visualization module plots the measured data on stereographic projections using three different methods, and can be used concurrently with the compass-clinometer module. The analysis module conducts instability analyses on the measured data, and can present the results in graphical and statistical forms. Users can send or receive data wirelessly with the data management module, even without a connection to a cellular network. To evaluate and validate the precision and accuracy of the compass-clinometer module, indoor and outdoor tests were conducted using Smart Compass-Clinometer and a conventional compass-clinometer. The minimum standard deviation of measured values with Smart Compass-Clinometer was 0.096° for dip and 0.122° for dip direction. The average difference between values measured using Smart Compass-Clinometer and the conventional compass-clinometer in the outdoor test was 1.70° for dip and 2.63° for dip direction. In an underground mine, the average discrepancies between Smart Compass-Clinometer and the conventional compass-clinometer were 2.57° in dip and 4.57° in dip direction. Smart Compass-Clinometer offers geoscientists a fast, reliable, and convenient tool for geological investigation. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",,,,"Lee S., Suh J., Park H.-D.",56480397400;36994115400;55751744245;,"Lee, S., Department of Energy Systems Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul 151-744, South Korea; Suh, J., Department of Energy Systems Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul 151-744, South Korea; Park, H.-D., Department of Energy Systems Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul 151-744, South Korea",Computers and Geosciences,Comput.

"A dynamic graphical interface for visualizing projected, measured, and reconstructed surface water elevations on the earth's largest lakes",2013,2-s2.0-84882633359,"There is a growing need within the international water research and water resources management community, and the general public, for easy access to time-series of projected, measured, and reconstructed marine and freshwater coastal surface water elevations. There is also a need for effectively communicating variability among different surface water elevation data sets, as well as the intrinsic uncertainties in surface water elevation forecasts. Here, we introduce an interactive web-based interface, the Great Lakes Water Level Dashboard (GLWLD), designed to address this need for the North American Laurentian Great Lakes, the largest assemblage of unfrozen fresh surface water bodies on planet Earth, and one with a coastline of over 16,000km (roughly 10,000 miles). The GLWLD is a Flash-based tool that can simultaneously display time-series of measured monthly and annual water level data and seasonal forecasts for each of the Great Lakes, reconstructed lake levels from paleoclimate research, and decadal lake level projections under alternative climate scenarios. By employing a suite of novel data transfer, processing, and visualization tools, the GLWLD allows users to seamlessly transition not only between alternate displays of Great Lakes water levels over different temporal scales, but between different data sets and forecasts as well. Furthermore, the unique GLWLD interface can help users understand the extent to which decisions regarding the use of the lakes depend on an appreciation of uncertainty and variability within, and between, different sources of Great Lakes water level information. © 2013.",,,,"Gronewold A.D., Clites A.H., Smith J.P., Hunter T.S.",24178079300;6603171952;55831108300;8710874900;,"Gronewold, A.D., Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Ann Arbor, MI 48108, United States; Clites, A.H., Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Ann Arbor, MI 48108, United States; Smith, J.P., Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Ann Arbor, MI 48108, United States, Cooperative Institute for Limnology and Ecosystems Research, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, United States; Hunter, T.S., Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Ann Arbor, MI 48108, United States",Environmental Modelling and Software,Environ.

In this article, we present an empirical approach to assess the effect of decision-time constraints on the quality of spatio-temporal decision-making when using 3D geo-browsers, such as GoogleEarth, in 3D task contexts of varying complexity. Our experimental results suggest that while, overall, people interact more with interactive geo-browsers when not under time pressure, this does not mean that they are also more accurate or more confident in their decisions when solving typical 3D cartometric tasks. Surprisingly, we also find that 2D interaction capabilities (i.e., zooming and panning) are more frequently used for 3D tasks than 3D interaction tools (i.e., rotating and tilting), regardless of time pressure. Finally, we find that background and training of tested users do not seem to influence 3D task performance. In summary, our study does not provide any evidence for the added value of using interactive 3D globe viewers when needing to solve 3D cartometric tasks with or without time pressure. © 2013 Cartography and Geographic Information Society.",,,,"Wilkening J., Fabrikant S.I.",50862357600;14324591800;,"Wilkening, J., Esri Deutschland GmbH, Ringstraße 7, 85402 Kranzberg, Germany; Fabrikant, S.I., Department of Geography, University of Zurich, Winterthurerstrasse 190, 8057 Zurich, Switzerland",Cartography and Geographic Information Science,Cartogr.

Introducing PEGI: A usability process for the practical evaluation of Geographic Information,2013,2-s2.0-84876533103,"As the use of Geographic Information (GI) is becoming more widespread, the usability of GI is being recognised as an important issue. However, exploring the usability of information products brings with it a range of problems that are not easily handled by traditional user centred design methods. This paper describes the Practical Evaluation of Geographic Information (PEGI) process, which consists of a series of usability research methods that have been modified for use with GI. Two case studies are also presented, describing the application of PEGI within a commercial product development process. The advantages and disadvantages of the PEGI process are discussed as well as plans for future research in this area. The potential value of this approach is also described in terms of cost-benefit, concluding that a £3000 evaluation process could help produce benefits of over £40,000 a year in cost savings and increased sales. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",,,,"Brown M., Sharples S., Harding J.",56387908000;10140073200;56637701100;,"Brown, M., Horizon Digital Economy Research, University of Nottingham Innovation Park, Triumph Road, Nottingham NG7 2TU, United Kingdom; Sharples, S., Innovative Technology Research Centre, Department of Mechanical, Materials and Manufacturing Engineering, University of Nottingham, University Park, Nottingham NG7 2RD, United Kingdom; Harding, J., User and User Needs Research Group, Ordnance Survey, Adanac Drive, Southampton SO16 0AS, United Kingdom",International Journal of Human Computer Studies,Int J Hum Comput Stud,2.0
An ontology-based framework for real-time collection and visualization of mobile field triage data in mass gatherings,2013,2-s2.0-84875516332,"Managing mass gathering events is a complex process. A key factor in successful management of mass gatherings is the availability of real-time data about the situation. This data is very useful in making important decisions that can potentially be life saving. In this paper, we propose an ontology-based framework for real-time collection and visualization of on field mobile triage data. The proposed framework uses a mobile device-assisted triage decision making system (iTriage). The system leverages a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) to efficiently share and visualize triage data aiding mass gathering administrators in determining the exact state of the situation. Our framework is driven by a domain ontology for mass gathering ensuring consistency in the shared data. We demonstrate a prototype implementation of the iTriage system on android-based mobile devices. Our experimental evaluations validate the iTriage system's ability to accurately compute patient priorities based on the triage sieve algorithm. Further, we demonstrate the capability of the proposed framework to visualize triage data on a map in real time. © 2012 IEEE.",,"46th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, HICSS 2013",7 January 2013 through 10 January 2013,"Jayaraman P.P., Gunasekera K., Burstein F., Delir Haghighi P., Soetikno H.S., Zaslavsky A.",24824284200;24829314000;7005835913;26424619100;55633574900;7006010714;,"Jayaraman, P.P., CSIRO ICT Centre, Monash University, Australia; Gunasekera, K., CSIRO ICT Centre, Monash University, Australia; Burstein, F., CSIRO ICT Centre, Monash University, Australia; Delir Haghighi, P., CSIRO ICT Centre, Monash University, Australia; Soetikno, H.S., CSIRO ICT Centre, Monash University, Australia; Zaslavsky, A., CSIRO ICT Centre, Monash University, Australia",Proceedings of the Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences,Proc.

Development of a 4D object-based system for visualizing the risk information of construction projects,2013,2-s2.0-84872257736,"Recently, risks in construction projects have been gradually increasing due to the upsizing of construction projects and the introduction of diverse new methods of construction. Risk management is employed to address potential risks, and on most construction sites risk management is implemented based on managers' intuition. Furthermore, risk analysis information is presented based on complicated numerical analysis, which reduce its usability in practical work. The purpose of this research was to develop a risk management visualization system that can analyze the degrees of risks in construction projects using objective quantifying methodologies for gathering risk information. The information is then presented based on the degree of risks involved. This system can be utilized as a tool to effectively respond to various types of construction risk information. To this end, the fuzzy and analytic hierarchy analysis (AHP) techniques are used as methods to quantify risk information. To visualize the risk information analyzed, a simulation system for visualizing risk information is developed along with a four-dimensional (4D) CAD system. The proposed system is applied to a sample construction project to verify its usability. A work space optimization method that considers risk information and work space is also suggested for further development of the system. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",,,,"Kang L.S., Kim S.-K., Moon H.S., Kim H.S.",7102331914;7601580565;35173329400;51461453000;,"Kang, L.S., Dept. of Civil Eng., ERI, Gyeongsang National University, South Korea; Kim, S.-K., Dept. of Civil Eng., Seoul National University of Science and Technology, South Korea; Moon, H.S., Dept. of Civil Eng., Gyeongsang National University, South Korea; Kim, H.S., Dept. of Civil Eng., Gyeongsang National University, South Korea",Automation in Construction,Autom Constr,27.0
The role of standards in spatial data quality visualisation,2013,2-s2.0-84892613993,"Geographic data files describe the real world from different points of view and give a direct or indirect reference to the geographical location. This data are constantly shared, interchanged and also used to different purposes for which they were primarily created. Spatial data quality is evolving as a core discipline of geographic information science (GIS/Geomatics). Starting with issues related to the error in spatial data there can be seen the focus on technological development over the years. Information about the quality of spatial data is necessary for the proper selection and use of these data. The main aim for data providers is the highest reuse of their data. This is only possible via the fulfilment of two prerequisites. Datasets satisfy the assumptions of end users and the degree in which are these assumptions met are fully documented. Both of these aspects have to lead to formalize the accessing the quality of spatial data. This situation is covered with a large number of standards and norms. These standards can stand as the background for accessing the quality of data for further visualisation of spatial data quality, because the nature of spatial data lends itself perfectly to the communication of quality parameters by visualization in the form of images and graphics. Paper is focused on research on spatial quality standards and their use in visualisation of spatial data quality. © SGEM2013 All Rights Reserved by the International Multidisciplinary Scientific GeoConference SGEM.",International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference,"13th International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference and EXPO, SGEM 2013",16 June 2013 through 22 June 2013,Brus J.,35772261000;,"Brus, J., Department of Geoinformatics, Palacký University in Olomouc, Czech Republic","International Multidisciplinary Scientific GeoConference Surveying Geology and Mining Ecology Management, SGEM","Int.

Real-time resource location data collection and visualization technology for construction safety and activity monitoring applications,2013,2-s2.0-84878579790,"Data to field operations of construction resources (personnel, equipment, materials) is vast, but the effort of collecting, analyzing, and visualizing is hardly ever taken. One main reason that limits higher quality in project site management decision making especially in resource intensive and complex operations is access to real-time information and subsequent technology that enables effortless data collection, processing, and visualization. Although recent developments in remote data sensing and intelligent data processing supplement manual data recording and analyze practices, few data on visualization tools in construction exist that gather data from dynamic resources and stream it to a field-realistic virtual reality environment in real-time. State-of-the-art technology in the field of real-time data collection and visualization is reviewed. A novel framework is presented that explains the method of streaming data from real-time positioning sensors to a real-time data visualization platform. Three case studies are presented which highlight its methods for recording data and visualizing information of construction activities in a (1) simulated virtual construction site, (2) outdoor construction setting, and (3) worker training environment. The results demonstrate that important construction information related to both safety and activity in field operations can be automatically monitored and visualized in real-time, thus offering benefits such as increased situational awareness to workers, equipment operators, or decision makers anywhere on a construction project or from a remote location. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Provision of awareness of learners' emotions through visualizations in a computer interaction-based environment,2013,2-s2.0-84878319805,"One of the challenges of intelligent systems for education is to use low-level data collected in computer environments in the form of events or interactions to infer information with high-level significance using artificial intelligence techniques, and present it through visualizations in a meaningful and effective way. Among this information, emotional data is gaining track in by instructors in their educational activities. Many benefits can be obtained if an intelligent systems can bring teachers with knowledge about their learner's emotions, learning causes, and learning relationships with emotions. In this paper, we propose and justify a set of visualizations for an intelligent system to provide awareness about the emotions of the learners to the instructor based on the learners' interactions in their computers. We apply these learner's affective visualizations in a programming course at University level with more than 300 students, and analyze and interpret the student's emotional results in connection with the learning process. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Uncertainty vs. spatial data quality visualisations: A case study on ecotones,2013,2-s2.0-84892583406,"The term of data quality should be used with caution because the concept of uncertainty and quality of spatial data are not synonymous, even though in many cases they are remarkably close to each other. They have highly similar characteristics and solve similar domains. In many cases, the quality and uncertainty are confused. Uncertainty in this sense is considered to be a characteristic that allows us to assess the quality of the data and how uncertainty affects the quality of spatial data. The basic difference is that the uncertainty can be introduced at any stage of the production of maps and GIS analyses (observation, conceptual modelling, measurement, analysis, etc.) and as such is not only related to the quality of spatial data themselves, but to the entire process. Sometimes we can see examples in the geoinformatics and geomatics when the pursuit of perfectly accurate and precision data are achieved, but perfect or near-perfect representation are the exception rather than the rule. Much common is the situation when is practically impossible to capture every single aspect due to intricate details of the world. In addition, different individuals perceive the world in different ways, and it is difficult to identify one valid and universally accepted theory. Visualisation is a strong tool to showing results by representation in a better way than text description of the quality of data. In the other hand, unsophisticated visualisation is insufficient due to the complexity of the spatial quality data problem. Based on this statement it is necessary to visualise also information about data quality and uncertainty. This paper describes different perspectives of uncertainty and spatial data quality visualisation in context of modelling the spatial distributions of ecotones. © SGEM2013 All Rights Reserved by the International Multidisciplinary Scientific GeoConference SGEM.",International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference,"13th International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference and EXPO, SGEM 2013",16 June 2013 through 22 June 2013,"Brus J., Pechanec V., Kilianova H.",35772261000;35772791400;35772530300;,"Brus, J., Department of Geoinformatics, Palacký University in Olomouc, Czech Republic; Pechanec, V., Department of Geoinformatics, Palacký University in Olomouc, Czech Republic; Kilianova, H., Department of Geoinformatics, Palacký University in Olomouc, Czech Republic","International Multidisciplinary Scientific GeoConference Surveying Geology and Mining Ecology Management, SGEM","Int.

Multiple perspective interactive search: A paradigm for exploratory search and information retrieval on the web,2013,2-s2.0-84886608375,"The World Wide Web (WWW) represents the largest and arguably the most complex repository of content at our current state of technological development. Information on the web is represented using a variety of media, with a (current) predominance of text- and images-based data and increasing presence of other media such as video and audio. The complexity and heterogeneity of the information implies that the associated semantics is often user-dependent and emergent. Thus, there is a need to develop novel paradigms for web-based user-data interactions that emphasize user context and interactivity with the goal of facilitating exploration, interpretation, retrieval, and assimilation of information. This article presents a novel presentation-interaction paradigm for exploratory web search which allows simultaneous and semantically correlated presentation of query results from different semantic perspectives. Users can explore the results either using a specific perspective or through a combination of perspectives via highly-intuitive yet powerful interaction operators. In the proposed paradigm, hits obtained from executing a query are first analyzed to determine latent content-based correlations between the pages. Next, the pages are analyzed to extract different types of perceptual and informational cues. This information is used to organize and present the results through an interactive and reflective user interface which supports both exploration and search. Experimental investigations, many of which are conducted in comparative settings, analyze the proposed approach in query-retrieval scenarios involving complex information goals. These results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach and provide important insights for the development of the nextgeneration of interfaces for web-search. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.",Kluwer Academic Publishers,,,"Singh R., Hsu Y.-W., Moon N.",55574239611;15050805900;15136882600;,"Singh, R., Department of Computer Science, San Francisco State University, San Francisco, CA 94132, United States; Hsu, Y.-W., Department of Computer Science, San Francisco State University, San Francisco, CA 94132, United States; Moon, N., Department of Computer Science, San Francisco State University, San Francisco, CA 94132, United States",Multimedia Tools and Applications,Multimedia Tools Appl,11.0
Integrated modeling within a hydrologic information system: An OpenMI based approach,2013,2-s2.0-84870295148,"This paper presents a prototype software system for integrated environmental modeling that provides interoperability between the Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Science, Inc. (CUAHSI) Hydrologic Information System (HIS) and the Open Modeling Interface (OpenMI). The primary motivation for making these two systems interoperable is that the CUAHSI HIS has a primary focus on hydrologic data management and visualization while the OpenMI has a primary focus on integrated environmental modeling. By combining the two systems into a single software application, it is possible to create an integrated environmental modeling environment that scientists and engineers can use to understand and manage environmental systems. Using standards to achieve the steps required to find, gather, integrate, and analyze hydrologic data allows for a wide community of groups to participate because it establishes key rules and protocols that must be followed in order to add to the overarching system. The key contribution of this work, therefore, is an investigation of two standards in the community and exploring ways to provide interoperability between them. HydroModeler is a software implementation of our work and provides an OpenMI-compliant modeling environment embedded within the CUAHSI HIS HydroDesktop software system. We describe the design and implementation of this prototype software system, and then present an example application in which evapotranspiration is modeled using OpenMI components that consume HIS time series data for input. Finally, we conclude with a summary of our experience exploring the potential for interoperability between data and modeling systems, and suggest ways in which future development can better facilitate connections between the various subsystems needed within an integrated environmental modeling system. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",,,,"Castronova A.M., Goodall J.L., Ercan M.B.",35490130700;9841782300;55062201900;,"Castronova, A.M., Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of South Carolina, 300 Main Street, Columbia, SC 29208, United States; Goodall, J.L., Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of South Carolina, 300 Main Street, Columbia, SC 29208, United States; Ercan, M.B., Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of South Carolina, 300 Main Street, Columbia, SC 29208, United States",Environmental Modelling and Software,Environ.

Map application of Czech Orienteering Federation Map archive,2013,2-s2.0-84892568115,"The map server application of the Czech Orienteering Federation Map Archive is providing information about maps for orienteering since 2004. With time this archive was no longer suitable for users' requirements. In the old application there were not enough good possibilities of viewing data and it was impossible to insert or edit any data. Before this application was developed it was necessary to do some analysis. Inputs to this analysis were suggestions from the previous application users and map archive administrator. Outputs from this analysis were catalogue of requirements, case study and a new data model. Nowadays there are plenty of technologies that provide visualisation and on-line editing of geographic data in web browser. Technologies from Google Company were chosen due to analysis. Data are stored in Google Fusion Tables. For data visualisation in map application is used Google Maps API. As a first step it was necessary to migrate geographic and table data to Fusion Tables and put watermark on raster images and resize them to 96DPI. Main result of this master thesis is the application that uses jQuery and JavaScript programming languages for client-side scripting and PHP for server-side scripting. Developed web application displays maps for orienteering sports in web browser. It supports a combination of graphic searching in map window and the text search on an advanced level based on the name of map and several other attributes. It also provides searching based on spatial analysis. Inputs could be a position entered in GPS coordinates or village name and a distance. Results from searching could be viewed in map, table or could even be downloaded in supported formats. In other modules application could obtain detailed information about authors, maps and clubs. It is effortlessly possible to switch between map and these modules. Web content management system of map archive application is realized in a secure mode. Authorization to administrator console uses your Google Account and OAuth2 protocol. In this section it is possible to insert and edit records of maps and their authors. Inserting of geometry is developed by using Google Drawing Library.

Automatic spatio-temporal analysis of construction site equipment operations using GPS data,2013,2-s2.0-84867236164,"A literature review revealed several major shortcomings in the analysis of construction equipment operations data, for example, the lack of using realistic or real-time positioning data that can feed into an equipment operations analysis or simulation model. This paper presents technology and algorithms that have the potential in aiding the automated assessment of construction site equipment operations. Utilizing commercially available low-cost global positioning system (GPS) devices enables the continuous data logging of equipment location in addition to simultaneously recording timestamps. However, before any such spatio-temporal equipment data can be reliably collected on construction sites, the error rate of the GPS devices had to be evaluated. Data analysis methods and rules for monitoring construction site equipment operations and activity were then defined. A detailed software interface was finally created that allows a user to set, analyze, and visualize several important equipment parameters towards achieving the goal of creating more realistic equipment operation analysis and potential for inclusion in simulation models. Results from field experiments show that the developed technology is able to identify and track equipment activity- and safety-related information automatically for job site performance and layout decision making, respectively. The presented work will aid construction project managers in making better decisions to plan, manage, and control equipment-related work tasks on construction sites. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Visual Analytics for model-based medical image segmentation: Opportunities and challenges,2013,2-s2.0-84885085106,"Segmentation of medical images is a prerequisite in clinical practice. Many segmentation algorithms use statistical shape models. Due to the lack of tools providing prior information on the data, standard models are frequently used. However, they do not necessarily describe the data in an optimal way. Model -based segmentation can be supported by Visual Analytics tools, which give the user a deeper in sight into the correspondence between data and model result. Combining both approaches, better models for segmen-tation of organs in medical images are created.

A hierarchical photo visualization system emphasizing temporal and color-based coherences,2012,2-s2.0-84869091312,"Most photograph management systems use a scrollable view based on a sequential grid layout that arranges photo thumbnails in some default order on the screen. Although users are very accustomed to this kind of photo layout, multiple drag and drop mouse interactions are required to search and obtain an overview of their photos. This paper describes a photo visualization system that visualizes hundreds of photos on a 2D grid space in order to help users manage their photos. Our system provides the following threemain functions. First, it places similar photos in terms of color histogram and shoot time close together on the grid. Therefore, users can find their photos using temporal and color-based coherences relating to human sensory information such as colors that invokes similar feelings and photo shoot time. Second, our system provides a hierarchical clustering method based on a 2D grid space. This function can decrease drag and drop mouse interactions when classifying photos into small groups compared to the sequential grid layout. Finally, our system displays a representative photo from each cluster, in order to provide a summarized view of multiple photos. For evaluation of our system, we conducted seven experiments consisting of four computational and three subjective evaluations making a comparison with a sequential grid layout. The computational evaluations consider the four features of space efficiency, temporal stability and color-based consistency between neighbor photos of the grid, and cluster similarity. The evaluations establish that our system can decrease space efficiency while improving the other features. The three subjective evaluations deal with our system's easeof- use from a subjective human perspective. Most people that participated in our experiments found that this photo visualization system was quite suited to finding and summarizing their photo content. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.",,,,"Ryu D.-S., Chung W.-K., Cho H.-G.",15136761300;35301742600;7403936958;,"Ryu, D.-S., Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering, Pusan National University, Keumjeong-gu, Busan, South Korea; Chung, W.-K., Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering, Pusan National University, Keumjeong-gu, Busan, South Korea; Cho, H.-G., Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering, Pusan National University, Keumjeong-gu, Busan, South Korea",Multimedia Tools and Applications,Multimedia Tools Appl,1.0
A novel approach to estimate proximity in a random forest: An exploratory study,2012,2-s2.0-84865043451,"A data proximity matrix is an important information source in random forests (RF) based data mining, including data clustering, visualization, outlier detection, substitution of missing values, and finding mislabeled data samples. A novel approach to estimate proximity is proposed in this work. The approach is based on measuring distance between two terminal nodes in a decision tree. To assess the consistency (quality) of data proximity estimate, we suggest using the proximity matrix as a kernel matrix in a support vector machine (SVM), under the assumption that a matrix of higher quality leads to higher classification accuracy. It is experimentally shown that the proposed approach improves the proximity estimate, especially when RF is made of a small number of trees. It is also demonstrated that, for some tasks, an SVM exploiting the suggested proximity matrix based kernel, outperforms an SVM based on a standard radial basis function kernel and the standard proximity matrix based kernel. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

P2TF: A comprehensive resource for analysis of prokaryotic transcription factors,2012,2-s2.0-84868688521,"Background: Transcription factors (TFs) are DNA-binding proteins that regulate gene expression by activating or repressing transcription. Some have housekeeping roles, while others regulate the expression of specific genes in response to environmental change. The majority of TFs are multi-domain proteins, and they can be divided into families according to their domain organisation. There is a need for user-friendly, rigorous and consistent databases to allow researchers to overcome the inherent variability in annotation between genome sequences.Description: P2TF (Predicted Prokaryotic Transcription Factors) is an integrated and comprehensive database relating to transcription factor proteins. The current version of the database contains 372,877 TFs from 1,987 completely sequenced prokaryotic genomes and 43 metagenomes. The database provides annotation, classification and visualisation of TF genes and their genetic context, providing researchers with a one-stop shop in which to investigate TFs. The P2TF database analyses TFs in both predicted proteomes and reconstituted ORFeomes, recovering approximately 3% more TF proteins than just screening predicted proteomes. Users are able to search the database with sequence or domain architecture queries, and resulting hits can be aligned to investigate evolutionary relationships and conservation of residues. To increase utility, all searches can be filtered by taxonomy, TF genes can be added to the P2TF cart, and gene lists can be exported for external analysis in a variety of formats.Conclusions: P2TF is an open resource for biologists, allowing exploration of all TFs within prokaryotic genomes and metagenomes. The database enables a variety of analyses, and results are presented for user exploration as an interactive web interface, which provides different ways to access and download the data.

Until recently, this task required discovering and navigating many different data repositories, each having its own website, query interface, data formats, and descriptive language. New advances in cyberinfrastructure and in semantic mediation technologies have provided the means for creating better tools supporting data discovery and access. In this paper we describe a freely available and open source software tool, called HydroDesktop, that can be used for discovering, downloading, managing, visualizing, and analyzing hydrologic data. HydroDesktop was created as a means for searching across and accessing hydrologic data services that have been published using the Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Science, Inc.

Development of a Web-based visualization platform for climate research using Google Earth,2012,2-s2.0-84864847837,"Recently, it has become easier to access climate data from satellites, ground measurements, and models from various data centers. However, searching, accessing, and processing heterogeneous data from different sources are very time-consuming tasks. There is lack of a comprehensive visual platform to acquire distributed and heterogeneous scientific data and to render processed images from a single accessing point for climate studies. This paper documents the design and implementation of a Web-based visual, interoperable, and scalable platform that is able to access climatological fields from models, satellites, and ground stations from a number of data sources using Google Earth (GE) as a common graphical interface. The development is based on the TCP/IP protocol and various data sharing open sources, such as OPeNDAP, GDS, Web Processing Service (WPS), and Web Mapping Service (WMS). The visualization capability of integrating various measurements into GE extends dramatically the awareness and visibility of scientific results. Using embedded geographic information in the GE, the designed system improves our understanding of the relationships of different elements in a four-dimensional domain. The system enables easy and convenient synergistic research on a virtual platform for professionals and the general public, greatly advancing global data sharing and scientific research collaboration. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",,,,"Sun X., Shen S., Leptoukh G.G., Wang P., Di L., Lu M.",56139054700;56282921300;6603405946;24072483700;7006684098;7402820329;,"Sun, X., China Institute of Manufacturing Development, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, 219 Ningliu Road, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210044, China, Key Laboratory of Meteorological Disaster of Ministry of Education, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, 219 Ningliu Road, Jiangsu 210044, China; Shen, S., Center for Spatial Information Science and Systems (CSISS), George Mason University, Fairfax, VA 22030, United States, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD 20771, United States; Leptoukh, G.G., NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD 20771, United States; Wang, P., China Institute of Manufacturing Development, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, 219 Ningliu Road, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210044, China; Di, L., Center for Spatial Information Science and Systems (CSISS), George Mason University, Fairfax, VA 22030, United States; Lu, M., China Institute of Manufacturing Development, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, 219 Ningliu Road, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210044, China",Computers and Geosciences,Comput.

"Visual, linguistic data mining using Self- Organizing Maps",2012,2-s2.0-84865094428,"Data mining methods are becoming vital as the amount and complexity of available data is rapidly growing. Visual data mining methods aim at including a human observer in the loop and leveraging human perception for knowledge extraction. However, for large datasets, the rough knowledge gained via visualization is often times not sufficient. Thus, in such cases data summarization can provide a further insight into the problem at hand. Linguistic descriptors such as linguistic summaries and linguistic rules can be used in data summarization to further increase the understandability of datasets. This paper presents a Visual Linguistic Summarization tool (VLS-SOM) that combines the visual data mining capability of the Self-Organizing Map (SOM) with the understandability of linguistic descriptors. This paper also presents new quality measures for ranking of predictive rules. The presented data mining tool enables users to 1) interactively derive summaries and rules about interesting behaviors of the data visualized though the SOM, 2) visualize linguistic descriptors and visually assess the importance of generated summaries and rules. The data mining tool was tested on two benchmark problems. The tool was helpful in identifying important features of the datasets. The visualization enabled the identification of the most important summaries. For classification, the visualization proved useful in identifying multiple rules that classify the dataset. © 2012 IEEE.",,"2012 Annual International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, IJCNN 2012, Part of the 2012 IEEE World Congress on Computational Intelligence, WCCI 2012",10 June 2012 through 15 June 2012,"Wijayasekara D., Manic M.",37562142700;6603474732;,"Wijayasekara, D., Computer Science Dept, University of Idaho, Idaho Falls, ID 83402, United States; Manic, M., Computer Science Dept, University of Idaho, Idaho Falls, ID 83402, United States",Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks,Proc Int Jt Conf Neural Networks,2.0
Time-aware visualization of document collections,2012,2-s2.0-84863580202,"Scientific articles are the major mechanism for researchers to report their results, and a collection of papers on a discipline can reveal a lot about its evolution, such as the emergence of new topics. Nonetheless, given a broad collection of papers it is typically very difficult to grasp important information that could help readers to globally interpret, navigate and then focus on the relevant items for their task. Content-based document maps are visual representations created from evaluating the (dis)similarity amongst the documents, and have been shown to support exploratory tasks in this scenario. Documents are represented by visual markers placed in the 2D space so that documents close share similar content. Albeit the maps allow visually identifying groups of related documents and frontiers between groups, they do not explicitly convey the temporal evolution of a collection. We propose a technique for creating content-based similarity maps of document collections that highlight temporal changes along time. Our solution constructs a sequence of maps from time-stamped sub-sets of the data. It adopts a cumulative backwards strategy to preserve user context across successive time-stamps, i.e., maps do not change drastically from one time stamp to the next, favouring user perception of changes. © 2012 ACM.",,"27th Annual ACM Symposium on Applied Computing, SAC 2012",26 March 2012 through 30 March 2012,"Alencar A.B., Börner K., Paulovich F.V., De Oliveira M.C.F.",24801980000;7006188708;15036217100;35421668500;,"Alencar, A.B., Instituto de Ciências Matemáticas e de Computaçã o, Universidade de São Paulo, Caixa Postal 668, São Carlos, SP, Brazil; Börner, K., School of Library and Information Science, Indiana University, Wells Library 021, 10th Street and Jordan Avenue, Bloomington, IN, United States; Paulovich, F.V., Instituto de Ciências Matemáticas e de Computaçã o, Universidade de São Paulo, Caixa Postal 668, São Carlos, SP, Brazil; De Oliveira, M.C.F., Instituto de Ciências Matemáticas e de Computaçã o, Universidade de São Paulo, Caixa Postal 668, São Carlos, SP, Brazil",Proceedings of the ACM Symposium on Applied Computing,Proc ACM Symp Appl Computing,11.0
MINI: A 3D mobile image browser with multi-dimensional datasets,2012,2-s2.0-84863589228,"Results of refined searches are often complicated because they have multi-dimensional attributes. Most of the existing retrieval systems display results in a grid or linear layout on small screens and do not visually represent the multi-dimensionality well. We think that multi-dimensional data visualization techniques can contribute to represent the distribution of the retrieval results based on multiple user-specified criteria and therefore assist the discovery of user-desired data items. This paper presents MINI (Mobile Image Navigate Interface), a novel 3D visualization system for retrieval results adopted to run on mobile platforms such as smart phones. MINI allows users to interactively browse multi-dimensional datasets based on priority of data items calculated from multiple user criteria. It achieves the display of retrieved data items in the 3D space while avoiding overlaps and preserving adequate representation of the items' priorities. It also supports interactive orientation and provides a zooming user interface. We expect users can conveniently browse the retrieval results as well as are able to easily select the desired data items through the use of touch panel screens. This paper also introduces the application of MINI in a recipe retrieval system, and the evaluation of effectiveness of the overlaps avoidance algorithm. © 2012 ACM.",,"27th Annual ACM Symposium on Applied Computing, SAC 2012",26 March 2012 through 30 March 2012,"Gomi A., Itoh T.",24831824300;35373203100;,"Gomi, A., Ochanomizu University, 2-1-1 Otsuka, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 112-8610, Japan; Itoh, T., Ochanomizu University, 2-1-1 Otsuka, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 112-8610, Japan",Proceedings of the ACM Symposium on Applied Computing,Proc ACM Symp Appl Computing,4.0
Real-time visual analytics for event data streams,2012,2-s2.0-84861046531,"Real-time analysis of data streams has become an important factor for success in many domains such as server and system administration, news analysis and finance to name just a few. Introducing real-time visual analytics into such application areas promises a lot of benefits since the rate of new incoming information often exceeds human perceptual limits when displayed linearly in raw formats such as textual lines and automatic aggregation often hides important details. This paper presents a system to tackle some of the visualization challenges when analyzing such dynamic event data streams. In particular, we introduce the Event Visualizer, which is a loosely coupled modular system for collecting, processing, analyzing and visualizing dynamic real-time event data streams. Due to the variety of different analysis tasks the system provides an extensible framework with several interactive linked visualizations to focus on different aspects of the event data stream.

This tool allows the competition among students for improving their learning process in a course. The tool takes some ideas from the Swiss-system widely used in chess and adapts them to the educational area. The competition is based on different tournaments and rounds. In each round, students are assigned in pairs of two, which compete one against another, and each pair receives different questions that students have to solve in a limit of time. Students can see their partial ratings after each round and their final rating after a tournament. A lot of knowledge from different disciplines was used to design, and implement this system, as ISCARE includes different functionality such as the students' registration into the system, the creation of tournaments, the registration and assignment of students to tournaments, the management of each tournament life cycle (started, in execution, finished, etc.), the addition of the different exercises to tournaments, the calculation of pairs of students for each round with different algorithms, the assignment of exercises per round and pair, the scorings of the students per round and tournament, the management of the students' ratings, or the visualization of information.

Monitoring industrial processes with SOM-based dissimilarity maps,2012,2-s2.0-84857648380,"Today's large scale availability of data from industrial plants is an invaluable resource to monitor industrial processes. Data-based methods can lead to better understanding, optimization or detection of anomalies. As a particular case, batch processes have attracted special interest due to their widespread presence in the industry. The aim of monitoring, in this case, is to compare different runs or implementations of a process with the baseline or normal operating one. On the other hand, visual exploration tools for process monitoring have been a prolific application field for self-organizing maps (SOM). In this paper, we exploit data-based models, obtained by means of SOM, for the visual comparison of industrial processes. For that purpose, we propose a method that defines a new visual exploration tool, called dissimilarity map. We also expose the need to consider dynamic information for effective comparison. The method is assessed in two industrial pilot plants that implement the same process. The results are discussed. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Questionnaire- versus voice-based screening for laryngeal disorders,2012,2-s2.0-84856517657,"The usefulness of questionnaire and voice data to screen for laryngeal disorders is explored. Answers to 14 questions form a questionnaire data vector. Twenty-three variables computed by the commercial ""Dr.Speech"" software from a digital voice recording of a sustained phonation of the vowel sound/a/constitute a voice data vector. Categorization of the data into a healthy class and two classes of disorders, namely diffuse and nodular mass lesions of vocal folds is the task pursued in this work. Visualization of data and automated decisions is also an important aspect of this work. To make the categorization, a support vector machine (SVM) is designed based on genetic search. Linear as well as nonlinear canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is employed, to study relations between the questionnaire and voice data sets. The curvilinear component analysis, performing nonlinear mapping into a two-dimensional space, is used for visualizing data and decisions. Data from 240 patients were used in the experimental studies. It was found that the questionnaire data provide more information for the categorization than the voice data. There are 3-4 common directions along which the statistically significant variations of the questionnaire and voice data occur. However, the linear relations between the variations occurring in the two data sets are not strong. On the other hand, very strong linear relations were observed between the nonlinear variates obtained from the questionnaire data and linear ones computed from the voice data. Questionnaire data carry great potential for preventive health care in laryngology. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Locally linear embedding based on correntropy measure for visualization and classification,2012,2-s2.0-84855229439,"Linear dimensionality reduction (DR) is a widely used technique in pattern recognition to control the dimensionality of input data, but it does neither preserve discriminability nor is capable of discovering nonlinear degrees of freedom present in natural observations. More recently, nonlinear dimensionality reduction (NLDR) algorithms have been developed taking advantage of the fact that data may lie on an embedded nonlinear manifold within an high dimensional feature space. Nevertheless, if the input data is corrupted (noise and outliers), most of nonlinear techniques specially Locally Linear Embedding (LLE) do not produce suitable embedding results. The culprit is the Euclidean distance (cost function in LLE) that does not correctly represent the dissimilarity between objects, increasing the error because of corrupted observations. In this work, the Euclidean distance is replaced by the correntropy induced metric (CIM), which is particularly useful to handle outliers. Moreover, we also extend NLDR to handle manifold divided into separated groups or several manifolds at the same time by employing class label information (CLI), yielding a discriminative representation of data on low dimensional space. Correntropy LLE+CLI approach is tested for visualization and classification on noisy artificial and real-world data sets. The obtained results confirm the capabilities of the discussed approach reducing the negative effects of outliers and noise on the low dimensional space. Besides, it outperforms the other NLDR techniques, in terms of classification accuracy. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",,,,"Daza-Santacoloma G., Castellanos-Dominguez G., Principe J.C.",33567633300;25640642900;36045958600;,"Daza-Santacoloma, G., Universidad Antonio Nariño, Faculty of Electronic and Biomedical Engineering, Bogotá, Colombia; Castellanos-Dominguez, G., Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Signal Processing and Recognition Group, Manizales, Colombia; Principe, J.C., University of Florida, Computational NeuroEngineering Lab, Gainesville, FL, United States",Neurocomputing,Neurocomputing,20.0
"Ontology-aided annotation, visualization, and generalization of geological time-scale information from online geological map services",2012,2-s2.0-84856602576,"Geological maps are increasingly published and shared online, whereas tools and services supporting information retrieval and knowledge discovery are underdeveloped. In this study, we developed an ontology of geological time scale by using a Resource Description Framework model to represent the ordinal hierarchical structure of the geological time scale and to encode collected annotations of geological time scale concepts. We also developed an animated graphical view of the developed ontology, and functions for interactions between the ontology, the animation and online geological maps published as layers of OGC Web Map Service. The featured functions include automatic annotations for geological time concepts recognized from a geological map, changing layouts in the animation to highlight a concept, showing legends of geological time contents in an online map with the animation, and filtering out and generalizing geological time features in an online map by operating the map legend shown in the animation. We set up a pilot system and carried out a user survey to test and evaluate the usability and usefulness of the developed ontology, animation and interactive functions.

Applied visual analytics for exploring the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey,2012,2-s2.0-84857941552,"The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is a research program to assess the health and nutritional status of the population in the United States. In this work, we present a visual analytics system designed to help researchers explore patterns and form hypotheses within the NHANES dataset. The visualization component of the environment is an extension of traditional scatterplot matrices. Since the upper portion of the scatterplot matrix is a redundant encoding, we utilize this space, to show the projected N-dimensional clustering of points. The rows and columns of the matrix are automatically ordered using information about the cluster projection in each space as a means of showing the most meaningful dimensions. A comparison module has also been included that allows the user to compare groupings of people to the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans.

A study about influenceable parameters in the choice of visualization techniques based on grounded theory,2011,2-s2.0-84865000407,"When visualization techniques are used to analyze results from a knowledge extraction process, it is necessary to choose the techniques according to certain criteria to ensure that the display is able to represent data as best as possible, especially when they are applied directly on data as an inference tool to extract information or as a way of data mining to get knowledge. In this context, this paper describes the parameters to be considered in the choice of these techniques in order to assist the analyst in the task of data exploration. These parameters are: data type, task type, data volume, dimensionality (number of attributes) and positioning of the attributes in the graph. The method used to identify the parameters is based on the Grounded Theory methodology. Further, this paper presents an analysis about the relation between that parameters and the visualization techniques of the different categories. © 2011 IADIS.",,"IADIS International Conference Computer Graphics, Visualization, Computer Vision and Image Processing 2011, Part of the IADIS Multi Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems 2011, MCCSIS 2011",24 July 2011 through 26 July 2011,"Yamaguchi J.K., Dias M.M.",55336309000;55938900100;,"Yamaguchi, J.K., State University of Maringá, Av.

A flexible framework for multi-volume data visualization,2011,2-s2.0-84865005760,"In this paper we present a framework for visualization of three-dimensional multiple volumetric datasets. We use such optimization strategies for GPU-based raycasting as the early ray termination and empty space skipping. An SMV (Stereo Multi-volume Viewer) provides such visualization techniques as Direct Volume Rendering via 1D- or 2D-transfer functions, multiple semi-transparent discrete isosurfaces, MIP, MIDA, etc. We also use random ray start position generation and further frames accumulation in order to reduce visual artifacts. The quality can be also improved by GPU-based volumetric tri-cubic up-sampling of the source datasets or by on-the-fly tri-cubic filtering during the rendering process. In addition to the clipping bounding box, user can use custom bounding mesh for more accurate region-of-interest selection. The SMV also supports 4 different stereoscopic visualization modes.

A framework for identifying user suitability to visualisation approaches,2011,2-s2.0-84864995403,Visualisation is a key approach to providing quick understanding of complex concepts. Presently very few visualisation systems attempt to understand the user in order to support the selection of the most appropriate visualization for the user and the task at hand.

Adequate 3D visualization of remotely sensed ICE shelf and sea surface temperature data,2011,2-s2.0-84865003014,"This article describes a novel approach, in which Long Wavelength Infrared and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) observations are combined in one single and comprehensive 3D representation of the study area that comprises the northern George VI ice shelf front and Marguerite Bay, on the west of the Antarctic Peninsula. Such a 3D model is generated without the use of any Digital Terrain Model. Instead of height information, data, Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and Radar backscattering coefficient respectively, derived from the raw observations are assigned to the z-axis. By such a three dimensional, multi-sensor model it is possible to make a statement about the actual situation of the ice shelf and the environmental conditions of the adjoining ocean. Furthermore it can be considered as the primary terrain representation that incorporates environmental information. Therefore it allows embedding observations made by other sensors in order to take further environmental parameters into account, and to generate time series to study spatiotemporal variations as well as possible interaction processes between the ice shelf and its surroundings. © 2011 IADIS.",,"IADIS International Conference Computer Graphics, Visualization, Computer Vision and Image Processing 2011, Part of the IADIS Multi Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems 2011, MCCSIS 2011",24 July 2011 through 26 July 2011,Staub G.,54406116600;,"Staub, G., University of Concepción, Campus Los Ángeles, Departamento de Ciencias Geodésicas y Geomática, J.A.

The competent edges are extracted using edge length as a parameter. In the final step, normalized correlation is performed by taking gray values of the image into account. The gray values of vertices that are selected using simplex method are taken and the normalized correlation is performed of vertices from the first image to the vertices of second image.

Gaussian mixture background model with shadow information,2011,2-s2.0-84864994636,"In this paper, we integrate shadow information into the background model of a scene in an attempt to detect both shadows and foreground objects at a time. Since shadows accompanying foreground objects are viewed as parts of the foreground objects, shadows will be extracted as well during foreground object detection. Shadows can distort object shapes and may connect multiple objects into one object. On the other hand, shadows tell the directions of light sources. In other words, shadows can be advantageous as well as disadvantageous. To begin, we use an adaptive Gaussian mixture model to describe the background of a scene. Based on this preliminary background model, we extract foreground objects and their accompanying shadows. Shadows are next separated from foreground objects through a series of intensity and color analyses. The characteristics of shadows are finally determined with the principal component analysis method and are embedded as an additional Gaussian in the background model. Experimental results demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed background model. © 2011 IADIS.",,"IADIS International Conference Computer Graphics, Visualization, Computer Vision and Image Processing 2011, Part of the IADIS Multi Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems 2011, MCCSIS 2011",24 July 2011 through 26 July 2011,"Wang J.-M., Chen S.-W., Fuh C.-S.",7701335791;7409889699;7005537734;,"Wang, J.-M., Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taiwan; Chen, S.-W., Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan Normal University, Taiwan; Fuh, C.-S., Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taiwan","Proc. of the IADIS Int.

Tongue segmentation from MRI images using ITK-SNAP: Preliminary evaluation,2011,2-s2.0-84864986322,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare the efficiency, reliability and accuracy of manual and semiautomatic segmentation techniques to segment tongue images. This work is included in a vast framework (HERON II) that aims to improve an articulatory-based speech synthesizer (SAP-Windows), for European Portuguese (EP). Volumetric data from Magnetic resonance images (MRI) were used to extract tongue configurations from several speakers uttering different EP sounds, or the same sound produced in different contexts or syllabic positions, in a speech production study. Segmentations were performed manually and using a semi-automatic approach implemented in ITK-SNAP (Region Competition Snakes). Results from similarity metrics (Jaccard coefficient and voxelwise comparison) revealed that the semi-automatic (SA) method presents good agreement with the manual segmentation method (Jaccard=0.9002 and 10.495 voxel error). Furthermore, the semi-automatic method is more reproducible (Jaccard=0.9382 and 6.388 voxel error) than manual segmentation method (Jaccard= 0.9170 and 8.662 voxel error). The semi-automatic approach provides an efficient and reliable method to segment tongue images providing 3D visualizations that allows description and comparison of tongue configurations during the production of different sounds.

In this paper we analyse and propose a valid approach for image registration using compression that works properly for different combinations of CT, MRI and PET images. © 2011 IADIS.",,"IADIS International Conference Computer Graphics, Visualization, Computer Vision and Image Processing 2011, Part of the IADIS Multi Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems 2011, MCCSIS 2011",24 July 2011 through 26 July 2011,"Vázquez P.-P., Marco J.",7006479983;8332219900;,"Vázquez, P.-P., MOVING Group, Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya, C/ Jordi Girona, 1-3, E-08034, Barcelona, Spain; Marco, J., Dep.

A fast and space-efficient discrete focal stack transform,2011,2-s2.0-84865019744,"Plenoptic cameras are a promising solution to increase the capabilities of current commercial cameras. They offer the possibility of focusing the scene after the capture of the photograph or to obtain 3D information. The use of plenoptic cameras to record a 3D scene has some benefits with respect to 3D capture systems based on camera arrays since there is no need of geometric and color calibration or frame synchronization. This paper presents a new technique to obtain the focal stack and 3D information from a plenoptic camera that drastically reduces the memory requirements of the previous Fast DFST algorithm without an increase in its computational complexity. From a practical point of view, in typical scenes we are able to decrease more than 60 times the memory needs of the Fast DFST. This new algorithm makes practical to obtain focal and 3D information with very high depth resolution from current plenoptic cameras. The information obtained can be used as the input of some autostereoscopic displays on the market and shows the feasibility of a plenoptic approach to 3DTV. © 2011 IADIS.",,"IADIS International Conference Computer Graphics, Visualization, Computer Vision and Image Processing 2011, Part of the IADIS Multi Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems 2011, MCCSIS 2011",24 July 2011 through 26 July 2011,"Nava F.P., Fumero S.",12753631600;55336677100;,"Nava, F.P., Departamento de Estadística, Investigación Operativa y Computación, Universidad de La Laguna, Spain; Fumero, S., Departamento de Estadística, Investigación Operativa y Computación, Universidad de La Laguna, Spain","Proc. of the IADIS Int.

Integration data hiding with JP3D compression on volumetric medical images,2011,2-s2.0-84865035334,"In this paper we discuss the combination of data hiding with compression in order to improve patient data management and maintainability. Data hiding is adapted here for interleaving patient information with volumetric medical images, while offering privacy and security. The image compression scheme under consideration is JP3D (JPEG2000 Part 10 standard) that gives support to volumetric datasets. The embedding is applied in the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) domain, before passing through the 3D-EBCOT (three dimensional Embedded Block Coding with Optimized Truncation) algorithm. By this way, the hidden data can be detected on the fly during image decoding, or, whenever we apply the DWT to the reconstructed image. Experiments performed on a database of Magnetic Resonance and Computerized Tomography sequences show that our data hiding scheme for data hiding performs a large data payload. Furthermore, it is robust against JP3D compression attack whereas keep a relative lower distortion. © 2011 IADIS.",,"IADIS International Conference Computer Graphics, Visualization, Computer Vision and Image Processing 2011, Part of the IADIS Multi Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems 2011, MCCSIS 2011",24 July 2011 through 26 July 2011,"Toueti M., Zaid A.O.",55337037200;55882710000;,"Toueti, M., SysCom Laporatory, National Engineering School of Tunis, 1002, Le Belvedere Tunis, Tunisia, Tunisia; Zaid, A.O., SysCom Laporatory, National Engineering School of Tunis, 1002, Le Belvedere Tunis, Tunisia, Tunisia","Proc. of the IADIS Int.

Depth value deduction using optical flow for reverse engineering,2011,2-s2.0-84864977166,"Optical flow is actually a tracking algorithm used for detecting moving features in images (at least two). With optical flow, we can get the motion magnitude and vector of the tracked features. In this paper, we proposed an algorithm to acquire 3D depth information from images using optical flow magnitude, while we filtered out the noise by using its vector. The idea; when rotating an object in front of sensors, nearer parts of the object will move more than further parts, which mean, the nearer part has a bigger magnitude than the latter. In this algorithm we are trying to achieve full automation in detecting 3D depth of the tracked features by exploiting the optical flow detected. To achieve this, we prepared an optimum environment for the implementation. Camera is placed at a specific location perpendicular to a black turntable with black background. With two images, one taken at zero degrees and one at 2.5 degree rotation, we apply a Pyramidal Implementation of Lucas Kanade optical flow to track detected features. Experiments are done to validate the 3D points constructed; three objects were tested quantitatively. The implementation of this framework succeeded in extracting features, estimating depth information and visualizing 3D result. Comparing with the real objects, we can conclude that the results are similar but not as accurate as conventional reverse engineering techniques. However, it will be a step forward to have a framework and a technique that greatly reduces cost and time, aside from being portable. Future research should be carried out in perfecting this framework because of its advantages and prospects. © 2011 IADIS.",,"IADIS International Conference Computer Graphics, Visualization, Computer Vision and Image Processing 2011, Part of the IADIS Multi Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems 2011, MCCSIS 2011",24 July 2011 through 26 July 2011,"Rahmat R.W., Azmi S.",35614233000;55336521400;,"Rahmat, R.W., Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang, Selangor, 43400, Malaysia; Azmi, S., Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang, Selangor, 43400, Malaysia","Proc. of the IADIS Int.

Unsupervised optimal discriminant plane with uncorrelated features,2011,2-s2.0-84865041703,"Optimal discriminant plane plays an important role in feature extraction and has been widely used in the pattern recognition field. On this basis, Jin et al. proposed uncorrelated optimal discriminant plane which is based on Fisher criterion function and the conjugated orthogonal constraint of the total-class scatter matrix. This method needs the class information to calculate the Fisher optimal discriminant vector. Thus, it can only be used in supervised pattern. This paper will extend it to the unsupervised case. The proposed method aims to optimize the defined fuzzy Fisher criterion function to figure out an optimal discriminant vector and fuzzy scatter matrices in an unsupervised way.

Brain medical image fusion based on ihs and log-Gabor with suitable decomposition scale and orientation for different regions,2011,2-s2.0-84865031964,"We propose two fusion methods, denoted IHS&LG+ and IHS&LG++, based on IHS and log-Gabor wavelet for fusing PET and MRI images by choosing suitable decomposition scale and orientation for different regions of images in the first method, and refining the fused intensity of the first method to further reduce color distortion and enforce the anatomical structure in the second method. Our methods use the hue angle of each pixel in PET image to divide both PET and MRI images into regions of high and low activity. The fused intensity of each region is obtained by inverse log-Gabor transforming of high frequency coefficients of MRI intensity and low frequency coefficients of PET intensity-component. Our experimental results on three sets of normal axial, normal coronal, and Alzheimer's disease brain images demonstrate that all three images fused by IHS&LG+ are with less color distortion and about the same structural information as the images fused by IHS&RIM, and all three images fused by IHS&LG++ are with both color and anatomical structural information closest to PET and MRI images both visually and quantitatively. © 2011 IADIS.",,"IADIS International Conference Computer Graphics, Visualization, Computer Vision and Image Processing 2011, Part of the IADIS Multi Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems 2011, MCCSIS 2011",24 July 2011 through 26 July 2011,"Lin P.-L., Huang P.-W., Chen C.-I., Tsai T.-T., Chan C.-H.",7403224919;7403658717;24831903600;55337040100;55336207000;,"Lin, P.-L., Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Providence University, Shalu Taichung 433, Taiwan; Huang, P.-W., Department of Computer Science and Engineering, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung 402, Taiwan; Chen, C.-I., Department of Computer Science and Engineering, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung 402, Taiwan; Tsai, T.-T., Department of Computer Science and Engineering, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung 402, Taiwan; Chan, C.-H., Department of Computer Science and Engineering, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung 402, Taiwan","Proc. of the IADIS Int.

The results obtained by this approach present the outline of the object. The second one is improved dense reconstruction approach based on a generated disparity map. For this approach, we improve the stereo matching algorithm. In fact, the initial disparity map is computed using a weighted dissimilarity measure with application of adaptive correlation windows. Then, planes are modeled by a set of planar surface patches. First, an initial set of planes is estimated using only reliable pixels. Then, those planes will be merged to obtain a final representation of the scene. Thus, each pixel and region will be assigned to a disparity layer according to a cost function which is subject of minimization.

Switching pairwise Markov chains for non stationary textured images segmentation,2011,2-s2.0-84865040824,"Hidden Markov chains (HMCs) have been extensively used to solve a wide range of problems related to computer vision, signal processing (Cappé, O., et al 2005) or bioinformatics (Koski, T., 2001). Such notoriety is due to their ability to recover the hidden data of interest using the entire observable signal thanks to some Bayesian techniques like MPM and MAP. HMCs have then been generalized to pairwise Markov chains (PMCs), which offer similar processing advantages and superior modeling possibilities. However, when applied to nonstationary data like multi-textures images, both HMCs and PMCs fail to produce tolerable results given the mismatch between the estimated model and the data under concern. The recent triplet Markov chains (TMCs) have offered undeniable means to solve such challenging difficulty through the introduction of a third underlying process that may model, for instance, the switches of the model along the signal. In this paper, we propose a new TMC that incorporates a switching PMC to model non stationary images.

In addition, the motion of the discrete bubbles includes buoyancy, cohesive forces, and drag interactions with the liquid. Moreover, the amount of gas transferred from a continuum fluid model to the discrete bubble model at nucleation sites varies in accordance with the impact of collision between particles.

Adaptive character motion synthesis by qualitative approach,2011,2-s2.0-84865012202,"Adaptive motion synthesis normally involves complicate computation from physical simulation. However some biological researchers believe that the neural system takes little effort in motor control. Instead of planning motion from ground up, living creatures may only maintain or tweak some basic motion pattern for qualitative properties of complicate interaction between body and environment. Inspired by this idea, in this paper, we proposed a new method for adaptive motion synthesis based on the qualitative control theory. Adaptive motion control is achieved through enhancing the structural stability, rather than counteracting perturbations. Compared with current simulation method, our algorithm is more computational efficient and has the potential to be accelerated by GPU. © 2011 IADIS.",,"IADIS International Conference Computer Graphics, Visualization, Computer Vision and Image Processing 2011, Part of the IADIS Multi Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems 2011, MCCSIS 2011",24 July 2011 through 26 July 2011,"Liu F., Yang X., Zhang J.",57194785628;55683846400;55882204300;,"Liu, F., National Center For Computer Animation, Media School, Bournemouth University, United Kingdom; Yang, X., National Center For Computer Animation, Media School, Bournemouth University, United Kingdom; Zhang, J., National Center For Computer Animation, Media School, Bournemouth University, United Kingdom","Proc. of the IADIS Int.

Super-resolution imaging: The use case of optical astronomy,2011,2-s2.0-84864988992,"Super-resolution is well known to increase the resolution of images below the pixel barrier. The work outlines the use case of super-resolution in astronomy science. The current state-of-the-art of high-resolution imaging in astronomy is reviewed, which leads to the problem of super-resolved images. Fundamental properties of astronomical images are demonstrated to define requirements. Astronomical images suffer from low illumination and noise. The range of spatial resolution is found from long-exposure image limited due to atmospheric blur, and a scale of perfect sampling adapted to diffraction-limited observations. Astronomical imaging is a trade-off between resolution and signal-to-noise ratio (S/N). The success of super-resolution is interfered by the quality of data, selection of the method, and a proper definition of the image formation and image reduction pipeline. This work provides a precise definition of the ill-posed and ill-described problem of super-resolution imaging in astronomy. A new method of automatic image registration is presented, which is especially designed for astronomical imagery. Based on the exploration of real astronomical images, the new method provides an accuracy in the order of 0.05 of the pixel dimension. Future milestones are found as the selection of an appropriate method of image deconvolution. With astronomical wide-field imaging, certain optical effects introduce varying point spread and image distortion. These will define the requirements for an appropriate solution to image deconvolution and to complete the task of super-resolution in astronomy. © 2011 IADIS.",,"IADIS International Conference Computer Graphics, Visualization, Computer Vision and Image Processing 2011, Part of the IADIS Multi Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems 2011, MCCSIS 2011",24 July 2011 through 26 July 2011,Bauer T.,24549102500;,"Bauer, T., Bluewater Multimedia Concepts, Heimerzheimer Str. 2, D-53332 Bornheim, Germany","Proc. of the IADIS Int.

Recognition of fire/smoke based on computer-vision image segmentation,2011,2-s2.0-84864987814,"Dangers of fire/smoke are recently serious whereas scientific research to fight them seems to be left behind. The newest innovations use cameras and computer algorithms to analyze the visible effects of fire and its motion in their applications. Their approaches present some drawbacks when working in spatial domain. The main difficulty is to identify objects if they do not occur at the expected position. In this paper, we present a fast and robust algorithm for recognition fire/smoke in a cluttered scene from a pair of cameras. The input images are first segmented according to a pre-determined disparity threshold map and the real-time disparities of the fire. Binary image processing techniques are used to reject noise introduced into the segmented images through low-resolution disparity calculations which consequently can lead to the gain of clearer results. In order to reduce the false alarms, a new segmentation method used in this approach shows that stereo vision segmentation is more accurate than the color-based method based on k-means segmentation for the overall recognition; more specifically for images taken in night. The wavelet and discrete cosine transforms are then used for image feature extraction for a neural network classifier hence the system could generate a warning in case the fire/smoke is recognized. © 2011 IADIS.",,"IADIS International Conference Computer Graphics, Visualization, Computer Vision and Image Processing 2011, Part of the IADIS Multi Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems 2011, MCCSIS 2011",24 July 2011 through 26 July 2011,"Umugwaneza M.P., Dukuzumuremyi J.P., Zou B.-J., Wang L., Liang Y.",26653841200;55336177000;8553584700;57215848461;8984547200;,"Umugwaneza, M.P., School of Information Science and Engineering, Central South University, Changsha, 410083, China; Dukuzumuremyi, J.P., School of Information Science and Engineering, Central South University, Changsha, 410083, China; Zou, B.-J., School of Information Science and Engineering, Central South University, Changsha, 410083, China; Wang, L., School of Information Science and Engineering, Central South University, Changsha, 410083, China; Liang, Y., School of Information Science and Engineering, Central South University, Changsha, 410083, China","Proc. of the IADIS Int.

Indication of methane gas in IR-imagery,2011,2-s2.0-84864985840,"There are human produced sources of methane gas, such as waste storages, that contribute to the global warmth and other negative effects. There is not much research on the correlation of such leakage and greenhouse effect. Methane gas is not visible for humans and thus impossible to detect using commercial cameras. Specially designed IR-camera can detect this gas and thus is used in this study. Using digital video taken over a waste disposal place we create a detection algorithm that is sensitive to the spectral and morphological characteristics of methane gas. Different kind of leakage can take place in waste disposal places. In case of small spot leakage there is a reason to assume failure in piping system and in case of widely spread leakage area we can state that it is caused by unsupervised storage of waste and this should be attended immediately. In digital video, background and target gas are distinguished using spectral and morphological classifiers, which are extracted from the analyzed IR-imagery. It is shown that indications of methane gas can be carried out efficiently using image processing techniques and the definition of turbulence of the image. © 2011 IADIS.",,"IADIS International Conference Computer Graphics, Visualization, Computer Vision and Image Processing 2011, Part of the IADIS Multi Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems 2011, MCCSIS 2011",24 July 2011 through 26 July 2011,"Åhlén J., Seipel S.",8876233400;14632811800;,"Åhlén, J., University of Gävle, Department of Industrial Development, IT and Land Management, 80176 Gävle, Sweden; Seipel, S., University of Gävle, Department of Industrial Development, IT and Land Management, 80176 Gävle, Sweden","Proc. of the IADIS Int.

SIMFOR: Towards a collaborative software platform for urban crisis management,2011,2-s2.0-84864982972,"Risk and crisis management has become an important topic for public and private organizations. Nowadays, an important problem concerns the management of disasters (flooding, fire, nuclear explosion ⋯) in urban environments. To face such events, different actors like firefighters, mayors, or policemen have typically to deal with a wide amount of data, each at different decision levels. Aggregating various data from various sources to prepare the scenario is then crucial in order to create a credible realistic environment. The project SIMFOR has been initiated to develop a ""serious game"" oriented towards risk and crisis management in a complex urban context. This game will provide a 3D multi-actor training platform, which will help the players to improve both the prevention and the reaction to critical situations. Several actors can be managed by AI based on multi-agent. Phenomena like fire propagation or transportation net can be simulated by physical models. The first part of this communication will be devoted to the problematic of risk and crisis management. It notably situates the potentiality of ""serious gaming"" in such problem, which involves to aggregate data in an interoperable way using ISO standards. Part two concerns the SIMFOR serious game prototype. It presents the software architecture and a game session concerning a car fire scenario. © 2011 IADIS.",,"IADIS International Conference Computer Graphics, Visualization, Computer Vision and Image Processing 2011, Part of the IADIS Multi Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems 2011, MCCSIS 2011",24 July 2011 through 26 July 2011,"Chambelland J.-C., Raffin R., Desbenoit B., Gesquière G.",36965955200;14054828300;6506869482;15032668000;,"Chambelland, J.-C., LSIS Laboratory, UMR CNRS 6168, ESIL Case 925163, Avenue de Luminy, F-13288 Marseille Cedex 09, France; Raffin, R., LSIS Laboratory, UMR CNRS 6168, ESIL Case 925163, Avenue de Luminy, F-13288 Marseille Cedex 09, France; Desbenoit, B., LSIS Laboratory, UMR CNRS 6168, ESIL Case 925163, Avenue de Luminy, F-13288 Marseille Cedex 09, France; Gesquière, G., LSIS Laboratory, UMR CNRS 6168, ESIL Case 925163, Avenue de Luminy, F-13288 Marseille Cedex 09, France","Proc. of the IADIS Int.

3D reconstruction of small solar system bodies using photoclinometry by deformation,2011,2-s2.0-84864980068,"This article considers the problem of reconstructing the 3D shape model of asteroids and cometary nuclei from images obtained with an imaging system on board a spacecraft. We present a photoclinometry method based on the minimization of the chi-square difference between observed and synthetic images of the object by deformations of its initial shape. The minimization is performed using the so-called ""limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Golbfarb- Shanno"" algorithm. The deformations can be applied: (i) by modifying the coefficients of a spherical harmonic expansion in order to extract the global shape of the object, and/or (ii) by moving the height of the vertices of a triangular mesh in order to increase the accuracy of the global shape model and/or to derive localized topographic maps of the surface.

Photomosaic using quad-tree structure on GPU,2011,2-s2.0-84864977615,"Photomosaic is a method of representation an input image in forms of mosaics by a set of small tile images. Generally, equal rectangular tiles are used in photo mosaics. Therefore, there are limitations to pictorialization according to characteristics of images. In this paper, photo mosaics using quad-tree structure is proposed to create tiles in varies sizes. Initially, color variance per each level of an input image is computed using the mipmap of graphic hardware. Depending on the value of variance, the input image is divided into tiles in varies sizes. Each tile finds the most similar reference image. As a result, the method provides another pictorial effectiveness by dividing the input image into tiles in varies sizes depending on color held by the input image. In addition, all processing is done on the graphic hardware and thereby allowing high performance. © 2011 IADIS.",,"IADIS International Conference Computer Graphics, Visualization, Computer Vision and Image Processing 2011, Part of the IADIS Multi Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems 2011, MCCSIS 2011",24 July 2011 through 26 July 2011,"Yang J., Joo C., Oh K.",55337160100;55336470100;18037986600;,"Yang, J., Department of Media, Soongsil University, South Korea; Joo, C., Department of Media, Soongsil University, South Korea; Oh, K., Department of Media, Soongsil University, South Korea","Proc. of the IADIS Int.

AN off-line Persian handwritten forgery detection method,2011,2-s2.0-84864973794,"The security of handwritten documents is very important in authentication systems. In this paper, a forgery detection method is proposed for Persian handwritten documents, which uses two types of novel features: Macro and Micro, Macro features show the structure of handwritten while micro ones show more details. Also, the micro features try to extract some online properties from offline data such as pen pressure and velocity. After extracting those features Weighted Euclidean Distance (WED) classifier is used to find forgery ones. It is very important that the weights of this classifier have been adjusted based on true data because forgery data are not identified in adjusting phase. To test the proposed method a Persian handwritten data set was prepared using three kinds of forgeries; Mimic, unskilled, and skilled. The method performance using different reference words showed the best result in correct rejection was 82% while the correct acceptance was 94%.

CAVE-SOM: Immersive visual data mining using 3D Self-Organizing Maps,2011,2-s2.0-80054719881,"Data mining techniques are becoming indispensable as the amount and complexity of available data is rapidly growing. Visual data mining techniques attempt to include a human observer in the loop and leverage human perception for knowledge extraction. This is commonly allowed by performing a dimensionality reduction into a visually easy-to-perceive 2D space, which might result in significant loss of important spatial and topological information. To address this issue, this paper presents the design and implementation of a unique 3D visual data mining framework - CAVE-SOM. The CAVE-SOM system couples the Self-Organizing Map (SOM) algorithm with the immersive Cave Automated Virtual Environment (CAVE). The main advantages of the CAVE-SOM system are: i) utilizing a 3D SOM to perform dimensionality reduction of large multi-dimensional datasets, ii) immersive visualization of the trained 3D SOM, iii) ability to explore and interact with the multi-dimensional data in an intuitive and natural way. The CAVE-SOM system uses multiple visualization modes to guide the visual data mining process, for instance the data histograms, U-matrix, connections, separations, uniqueness and the input space view. The implemented CAVE-SOM framework was validated on several benchmark problems and then successfully applied to analysis of wind-power generation data.

Unsupervised neural models for country and political risk analysis,2011,2-s2.0-79959964835,"This interdisciplinary research project focuses on relevant applications of Knowledge Discovery and Artificial Neural Networks in order to identify and analyze levels of country, business and political risk. Its main goal is to help business decision-makers understand the dynamics within the emerging market countries in which they operate. Most of the neural models applied in this study are defined within the framework of unsupervised learning. They are based on Exploratory Projection Pursuit, Topology Preserving Maps and Curvilinear Component Analysis. Two interesting real data sets are analyzed to empirically probe the robustness of these models. The first case study describes information from a significant sample of Spanish multinational enterprises (MNEs). It analyses data pertaining to such aspects as decisions over the location of subsidiary enterprises in various regions across the world, the importance accorded to such decisions and the driving forces behind them. Through a projection-based analysis, this study reveals a range of different reasons underlying the internationalization strategies of Spanish MNEs and the different goals they pursue. It may be concluded that projection connectionist techniques are of immense assistance in the process of identifying the internationalization strategies of Spanish MNEs, their underlying motives and the goals they pursue.

A web-based photo management system for large photo collections with user-customizable quality assessment,2011,2-s2.0-79959304208,"The affordability of digital cameras, storages, processors and the advances in these areas are encouraging people to take hundreds of photos at once. However, managing the large number of photographs involves arduous tasks such as selecting good quality photos and classifying and labeling each photo. Generally, users put their photos into certain user-designated folders on their local PC without considering any classified information. One of the main problems related to this management method is that users do not create their photo folders systematically because they are carelessness and apathetic. This practice results in confusion when users want to find their photos. One method to overcome this problem is to construct a central photo management system that can manage many photos on the user's local PC. It also can provide smart functions such as automated clustering and summarized visualization for many photos. This paper describes an integrated photo management system coupled with a database on the web, which provides users with an automated photo clustering and visualization function that allows photo overlaps. Our system also provides users with an automated photo quality evaluation based on Depth of Field (DOF) and blur. In order to evaluate our system, we conducted a user study on user-friendliness based on a questionnaire. © 2011 ACM.",,"26th Annual ACM Symposium on Applied Computing, SAC 2011",21 March 2011 through 24 March 2011,"Ryu D.-S., Kim K.H., Park S.-Y., Cho H.-G.",15136761300;47962121000;57191670907;7403936958;,"Ryu, D.-S., Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering, Pusan National University, Geumjeong-gu, Busan, 609-735, South Korea; Kim, K.H., Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering, Pusan National University, Geumjeong-gu, Busan, 609-735, South Korea; Park, S.-Y., Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering, Pusan National University, Geumjeong-gu, Busan, 609-735, South Korea; Cho, H.-G., Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering, Pusan National University, Geumjeong-gu, Busan, 609-735, South Korea",Proceedings of the ACM Symposium on Applied Computing,Proc ACM Symp Appl Computing,7.0
Relevance learning in generative topographic mapping,2011,2-s2.0-79953034727,"Generative topographic mapping (GTM) provides a flexible statistical model for unsupervised data inspection and topographic mapping. Since it yields to an explicit mapping of a low-dimensional latent space to the observation space and an explicit formula for a constrained Gaussian mixture model induced thereof, it offers diverse functionalities including clustering, dimensionality reduction, topographic mapping, and the like. However, it shares the property of most unsupervised tools that noise in the data cannot be recognized as such and, in consequence, is visualized in the map. The framework of visualization based on auxiliary information and, more specifically, the framework of learning metrics as introduced in [14,21] constitutes an elegant way to shape the metric according to auxiliary information at hand such that only those aspects are displayed in distance-based approaches which are relevant for a given classification task. Here we introduce the concept of relevance learning into GTM such that the metric is shaped according to auxiliary class labels. Relying on the prototype-based nature of GTM, efficient realizations of this paradigm are developed and compared on a couple of benchmarks to state-of-the-art supervised dimensionality reduction techniques. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",,,,"Gisbrecht A., Hammer B.",36655721700;55791279400;,"Gisbrecht, A., University of Bielefeld, CITEC Cluster of Excellence, Germany; Hammer, B., University of Bielefeld, CITEC Cluster of Excellence, Germany",Neurocomputing,Neurocomputing,10.0

An experimental study of financial portfolio selection with visual analytics for decision support,2011,2-s2.0-79952908697,"We investigate the decision process as applied to the practical task of choosing a financial portfolio. We developed PortfolioCompare, an interactive visual analytic decision support tool that helps the consumer quickly create, compare and choose among several portfolios consisting of different financial instruments. PortfolioCompare facilitates the analysis of risk and return aspects of each portfolio considered. We investigate behavior in this task using an economic experiment in which the user actively creates and compares portfolios from a set of funds. We elicit risk preferences using a separate task and find that subjects using PortfolioCompare make decisions that are closer to their risk tolerance as compared to subjects presented with similar information in textual form. This finding suggests that PortfolioCompare helps understand risk aspects of portfolios. Portfolio selections are improved during the course of the decision process, suggesting that this tool is valuable for decision support. © 2011 IEEE.",,"44th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, HICSS-44 2010",4 January 2011 through 7 January 2011,"Savikhin A., Lam H.C., Fisher B., Ebert D.S.",24475402200;37048858900;56363838400;35361180100;,"Savikhin, A., University of Chicago, United States; Lam, H.C., Simon Fraser University, Canada; Fisher, B., Simon Fraser University, Canada; Ebert, D.S., Purdue University, United States",Proceedings of the Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences,Proc.

Describing temporal correlation spatially in a visual analytics environment,2011,2-s2.0-79952919202,"In generating and exploring hypotheses, analysts often want to know about the relationship between data values across time and space. Often, the analysis begins at a world level view in which the overall temporal trend of the data is analyzed and linear correlations between various factors are explored. However, such an analysis often fails to take into account the underlying spatial structure within the data. In this work, we present an interactive visual analytics system for exploring temporal linear correlations across a variety of spatial aggregations. Users can interactively select temporal regions of interest within a calendar view window. The correlation coefficient between the selected time series is automatically calculated and the resultant value is displayed to the user. Simultaneously, a linked geospatial viewing window of the data provides information on the temporal linear correlations of the selected spatial aggregation level. Linear correlation values between time series are displayed as a choropleth map using a divergent color scheme. Furthermore, the statistical significance of each linear correlation value is calculated and regions in which the correlation value falls within the 95% confidence interval are highlighted. In this manner, analysts are able to explore both the global temporal linear correlations, as well as the underlying spatial factors that may be influencing the overall trend. © 2011 IEEE.",,"44th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, HICSS-44 2010",4 January 2011 through 7 January 2011,"Malik A., Maciejewski R., Hodgess E., Ebert D.S.",36006846000;23987550600;8896714200;35361180100;,"Malik, A., Purdue University Visualization and Analytics Center (PURVAC), United States; Maciejewski, R., Purdue University Visualization and Analytics Center (PURVAC), United States; Hodgess, E., University of Houston - Downtown, United States; Ebert, D.S., Purdue University Visualization and Analytics Center (PURVAC), United States",Proceedings of the Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences,Proc.

A concept-driven biomedical knowledge extraction and visualization framework for conceptualization of text corpora,2010,2-s2.0-78649323301,"A number of techniques such as information extraction, document classification, document clustering and information visualization have been developed to ease extraction and understanding of information embedded within text documents. However, knowledge that is embedded in natural language texts is difficult to extract using simple pattern matching techniques and most of these methods do not help users directly understand key concepts and their semantic relationships in document corpora, which are critical for capturing their conceptual structures. The problem arises due to the fact that most of the information is embedded within unstructured or semi-structured texts that computers can not interpret very easily. In this paper, we have presented a novel Biomedical Knowledge Extraction and Visualization framework, BioKEVis to identify key information components from biomedical text documents. The information components are centered on key concepts. BioKEVis applies linguistic analysis and Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) to identify key concepts. The information component extraction principle is based on natural language processing techniques and semantic-based analysis. The system is also integrated with a biomedical named entity recognizer, ABNER, to tag genes, proteins and other entity names in the text. We have also presented a method for collating information extracted from multiple sources to generate semantic network. The network provides distinct user perspectives and allows navigation over documents with similar information components and is also used to provide a comprehensive view of the collection. The system stores the extracted information components in a structured repository which is integrated with a query-processing module to handle biomedical queries over text documents. We have also proposed a document ranking mechanism to present retrieved documents in order of their relevance to the user query. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.",,,,"Jahiruddin, Abulaish M., Dey L.",35590173900;6505934038;6603939167;,"Jahiruddin, Department of Computer Science, Jamia Millia Islamia (A Central University), New Delhi, India; Abulaish, M., Department of Computer Science, Jamia Millia Islamia (A Central University), New Delhi, India; Dey, L., Innovation Labs, Tata Consultancy Services, New Delhi, India",Journal of Biomedical Informatics,J.

An incremental space to visualize dynamic data sets,2010,2-s2.0-77955175877,"In Information Visualization, adding and removing data elements can strongly impact the underlying visual space. We have developed an inherently incremental technique (incBoard) that maintains a coherent disposition of elements from a dynamic multidimensional data set on a 2D grid as the set changes. Here, we introduce a novel layout that uses pairwise similarity from grid neighbors, as defined in incBoard, to reposition elements on the visual space, free from constraints imposed by the grid. The board continues to be updated and can be displayed alongside the new space. As similar items are placed together, while dissimilar neighbors are moved apart, it supports users in the identification of clusters and subsets of related elements. Densely populated areas identified in the incSpace can be efficiently explored with the corresponding incBoard visualization, which is not susceptible to occlusion. The solution remains inherently incremental and maintains a coherent disposition of elements, even for fully renewed sets. The algorithm considers relative positions for the initial placement of elements, and raw dissimilarity to fine tune the visualization. It has low computational cost, with complexity depending only on the size of the currently viewed subset, V. Thus, a data set of size N can be sequentially displayed in O(N) time, reaching O(N2) only if the complete set is simultaneously displayed. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010.",,,,"De Pinho R.D., De Oliveira M.C.F., De Andrade Lopes A.",16304960000;35421668500;15032551400;,"De Pinho, R.D., Universidade de São Paulo, Caixa Postal 668, São Carlos, 13560-970, Brazil; De Oliveira, M.C.F., Universidade de São Paulo, Caixa Postal 668, São Carlos, 13560-970, Brazil; De Andrade Lopes, A., Universidade de São Paulo, Caixa Postal 668, São Carlos, 13560-970, Brazil",Multimedia Tools and Applications,Multimedia Tools Appl,11.0
Gradient-based SOM clustering and visualisation methods,2010,2-s2.0-79959478034,"Data clustering has been a major research and application topic in data mining. The self-organizing map (SOM) has been widely applied to tasks including multivariate data visualization and clustering. SOM not only quantizes the input data but also enables visual display of data, a property that does not exist in most clustering algorithms. In the past decade many developments have reported towards to mining useful information from a trained map. Most of them use post-processing methods in a two- or three-step procedure to enable finding clusters as contiguous regions on the map. The basic assumption relies on the data density approximation by the neurons through the unsupervised learning. By analyzing neighboring neurons and their relations and activities it is possible to draw, in many cases, the geometry of clusters. This paper discusses issues related to SOM clustering and segmentation with morphological image processing methods, such as filtering and watershed transform. It also briefly reviews SOM clustering related literature, such as surface-based and clustering (hierarchical and partitioning) algorithms.

Visualization of gridded scalar data with uncertainty in geosciences,2010,2-s2.0-77956722135,"Characterization of the earth's subsurface involves the construction of 3D models from sparse data and so leads to simulation results that involve some degree of uncertainty. This uncertainty is often neglected in the subsequent visualization, due to the fact that no established methods or available software exist.

We render these data as isosurfaces and make use of a colour scheme, which intuitively gives the viewer an idea of which parts of the surface are more reliable than others. We further show how to extract an envelope that indicates within which volume the isosurface will lie with a certain confidence, and augment the isosurfaces with additional geometry in order to show this information. The resulting visualization is easy and intuitive to understand and is suitable for rendering multiple distinguishable isosurfaces at a time. It can moreover be easily used together with other visualized objects, such as the geological context.

Our system decreases drag and drop mouse interaction when they classify their photos into small groups comparing to the sequential grid layout. We conducted experiments to evaluate our system. They consider four features: space efficiency, temporal stability and spatial consistency between neighbor photos of the grid, and cluster similarity.

Enhancing document structure analysis using visual analytics,2010,2-s2.0-77954701096,"During the last decade national archives, libraries, museums and companies started to make their records, books and files electronically available. In order to allow efficient access of this information, the content of the documents must be stored in database and information retrieval systems. State-of-the-art indexing techniques mostly rely on the information explicitly available in the text portions of documents. Documents usually contain a significant amount of implicit information such as their logical structure which is not directly accessible (unless the documents are available as well-structured XML-files) and is therefore not used in the search process. In this paper, a new approach for analyzing the logical structure of text documents is presented. The problem of state-of-the-art methods is that they have been developed for a particular type of documents and can only handle documents of that type. In most cases, adaptation and re-training for a different document type is not possible. Our proposed method allows an efficient and effective adaptation of the structure analysis process by combining state-of-the-art machine learning with novel interactive visualization techniques, allowing a quick adaptation of the structure analysis process to unknown document classes and new tasks without requiring a predefined training set. © 2010 ACM.",,"25th Annual ACM Symposium on Applied Computing, SAC 2010",22 March 2010 through 26 March 2010,"Stoffel A., Spretke D., Kinnemann H., Keim D.A.",16403514000;36176499400;36175844800;34769953100;,"Stoffel, A., Siemens AG, Germany; Spretke, D., University of Konstanz, Germany; Kinnemann, H., Siemens AG, Germany; Keim, D.A., University of Konstanz, Germany",Proceedings of the ACM Symposium on Applied Computing,Proc ACM Symp Appl Computing,14.0
Adaptive local dissimilarity measures for discriminative dimension reduction of labeled data,2010,2-s2.0-77649237216,"Due to the tremendous increase of electronic information with respect to the size of data sets as well as their dimension, dimension reduction and visualization of high-dimensional data has become one of the key problems of data mining. Since embedding in lower dimensions necessarily includes a loss of information, methods to explicitly control the information kept by a specific dimension reduction technique are highly desirable. The incorporation of supervised class information constitutes an important specific case. The aim is to preserve and potentially enhance the discrimination of classes in lower dimensions. In this contribution we use an extension of prototype-based local distance learning, which results in a nonlinear discriminative dissimilarity measure for a given labeled data manifold. The learned local distance measure can be used as basis for other unsupervised dimension reduction techniques, which take into account neighborhood information. We show the combination of different dimension reduction techniques with a discriminative similarity measure learned by an extension of learning vector quantization (LVQ) and their behavior with different parameter settings. The methods are introduced and discussed in terms of artificial and real world data sets. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Thus, a set of size N can be sequentially displayed in O(N) time, reaching at most O(N2) only if viewing the whole set at once. Consistent results were obtained as compared to (non-incremental) multidimensional scaling solutions. Moreover, the corresponding visualization is not susceptible to occlusion. The technique was tested in different domains, being particularly adequate to display dynamic corpora.

Visualization of clustered directed acyclic graphs with node interleaving,2009,2-s2.0-70350062294,"Graph drawing and visualization represent structural information as diagrams of abstract graphs and networks. An important subset of graphs is directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). E-Spring algorithm, extended from the popular spring embedder model, eliminates node overlaps in clustered DAGs by modeling nodes as charged particles whose repulsion is controlled by edges modeled as springs. The drawing process needs to reach a stable state when the average distances of separation between nodes are near optimal. This paper presents an enhancement to E-Spring to introduce a stopping condition, which reduces equilibrium distances between nodes and therefore results in a significantly reduced area for DAG visualization. It imposes an upper bound on the repulsive forces between nodes based on graph geometry. The algorithm employs node interleaving to eliminate any residual node overlaps. These new techniques have been validated by visualizing eBay buyer-seller relationships and resulted in overall area reductions in the range of 45% to 79%.

Global-to-local representation and visualization of molecular surfaces using deformable models,2009,2-s2.0-72949107790,"Macromolecules such as proteins and enzymes are responsible for most of cellular functionality. Many molecular interactions, such as protein-protein interactions or protein-ligand binding, occur at what can be defined as the molecular surface. The topology of the molecular surface is often complex, containing various geometric features such as clefts, cavities, tunnels, and flat regions. These geometric features coupled with non-geometric physicochemical properties influence surface-based molecular interactions. Consequently analysis of molecular surfaces is crucial in elucidating structure-property relationships of molecules. In this paper we propose a method for visualizing a molecular surface in a manner that preserves and elucidates salient features. The method involves mapping of a molecular surface to a standard spherical coordinate system. The ability to map arbitrary molecular surfaces to a standard coordinate system aids in comparison of surface features across different molecules. The mapping is accomplished by enclosing the molecular surface by a sphere, and then iteratively deforming the sphere until it converges by wrapping the entire molecular surface. This allows a one-to-one relationship to be established between points on the molecular surface and points on the surface of the sphere. The presence of discontinuities such as tunnels in the molecular surface can be identified by detecting collision between patches of the deforming sphere. Subsequently, the deformable surface is restored back to the sphere, retaining the mapping. Features and properties defined at the molecular surface are then mapped and visualized in the standard spherical coordinate system. The proposed approach has several key advantages. First, it allows a global-to-local visualization of molecular surfaces. Second, it facilitates comparison of specific features as well as collection of features within and across molecules by mapping them to a common coordinate system. Third, the method allows visualization of both geometric and non-geometric surface properties. Fourth, specific molecular characteristics can be visualized individually or in combination on-demand. Finally, and crucially the advantages offered by the proposed visualization do not involve simplification of the surface characteristics thereby ensuring that no loss of potentially important information occurs.

Projecting code changes onto execution traces to support localization of recently introduced bugs,2009,2-s2.0-72949105789,"Working collaboratively on complex software systems often leads to situations where a developer enhances or extends system functionality, thereby however, introducing bugs. At best the unintentional changes are caught immediately by regression tests. Often however, the bugs are detected days or weeks later by other developers noticing strange system behavior while working on different parts of the system. Then it is a highly time-consuming task to trace back this behavior change to code changes in the past. In this paper we propose a technique for identifying the recently introduced change that is responsible for the unexpected behavior. The key idea is to combine dynamic, static, and code change information on the system to reduce the possibly great amount of code modifications to those that may affect the system while running its faulty behavior. After having applied this massive automated filtering step, developers receive support in semi-automatically identifying the root cause change by means of a trace exploration frontend. Within multiple synchronized views, developers explore when, how and why modified code locations are executed. The technique is implemented within a prototypical analysis tool that copes with large (> MLOC) C/C++ software systems. We demonstrate the approach by means of industrial case studies.

P2CS: A two-component system resource for prokaryotic signal transduction research,2009,2-s2.0-68049092764,"Background: With the escalation of high throughput prokaryotic genome sequencing, there is an ever-increasing need for databases that characterise, catalogue and present data relating to particular gene sets and genomes/metagenomes. Two-component system (TCS) signal transduction pathways are the dominant mechanisms by which micro-organisms sense and respond to external as well as internal environmental changes. These systems respond to a wide range of stimuli by triggering diverse physiological adjustments, including alterations in gene expression, enzymatic reactions, or protein-protein interactions. Description: We present P2CS (Prokaryotic 2-Component Systems), an integrated and comprehensive database of TCS signal transduction proteins, which contains a compilation of the TCS genes within 755 completely sequenced prokaryotic genomes and 39 metagenomes. P2CS provides detailed annotation of each TCS gene including family classification, sequence features, functional domains, as well as genomic context visualization. To bypass the generic problem of gene underestimation during genome annotation, we also constituted and searched an ORFeome, which improves the recovery of TCS proteins compared to searches on the equivalent proteomes. Conclusion: P2CS has been developed for computational analysis of the modular TCSs of prokaryotic genomes and metagenomes. It provides a complete overview of information on TCSs, including predicted candidate proteins and probable proteins, which need further curation/validation.

Developing a geovisual analytics environment for investigating archaeological events: Extending the space-time cube,2009,2-s2.0-70349124566,"Over the past several decades, archaeologists have been developing and improving methods for collection, analysis, visualization, and modeling of site information. Despite the increasing capabilities of GIScience tools in recent years, archaeology is an application domain where these capabilities have not been fully utilized. This paper presents preliminary results on the development of geovisual analytics functions for archaeological investigation by extending Space-Time Cube (STC) software currently under development. Graph-theoretical techniques are implemented to uncover and visualize spatio-temporal relationships between artefacts from different historical periods excavated at different locations. These techniques are implemented and tested on a database of archaeological sites in Puerto Rico. The contribution of this research to visual analytics is the integration of space, time, and relationships within a single interactive environment. The extended STC facilitates insight into potential interactions or clashes among different cultures identified through archaeological digs. This is achieved through building linkages between database tuples based on attribute similarities which can be explicitly visualized and queried within the STC environment. The paper concludes with a summary of the effectiveness and potential of the prototype and its functionality.",,,,"Huisman O., Santiago I.F., Kraak M.-J., Retsios B.",56448720900;35077856500;7006292890;34880762100;,"Huisman, O., International Institute for Geo-lnformation Science and Earth Observation (ITC), Hengelosestraat 99, 7500AA Enschede, Netherlands; Santiago, I.F., International Institute for Geo-lnformation Science and Earth Observation (ITC), Hengelosestraat 99, 7500AA Enschede, Netherlands; Kraak, M.-J., International Institute for Geo-lnformation Science and Earth Observation (ITC), Hengelosestraat 99, 7500AA Enschede, Netherlands; Retsios, B., International Institute for Geo-lnformation Science and Earth Observation (ITC), Hengelosestraat 99, 7500AA Enschede, Netherlands",Cartography and Geographic Information Science,Cartogr.

Patch clustering for massive data sets,2009,2-s2.0-61849124176,"The presence of huge data sets poses new problems to popular clustering and visualization algorithms such as neural gas (NG) and the self-organising-map (SOM) due to memory and time constraints. In such situations, it is no longer possible to store all data points in the main memory at once and only a few, ideally only one run over the whole data set is still affordable to achieve a feasible training time. In this contribution we propose single pass extensions of the classical clustering algorithms NG and SOM which are based on a simple patch decomposition of the data set and fast batch optimization schemes of the underlying cost function. The algorithms only require a fixed memory space. They maintain the benefits of the original ones including easy implementation and interpretation as well as large flexibility and adaptability. We demonstrate that parallelization of the methods becomes easily possible and we show the efficiency of the approach in a variety of experiments. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Including the user in the knowledge discovery loop: interactive itemset-driven rule extraction,2008,2-s2.0-56749155047,"We introduce a user-driven approach to mining association rules, integrated into a visualization system, called I2E, that allows miners to depart from a reduced and representative subset of rules to interactively explore the whole rule space. A visualization of the space of k-itemsets displayed after each iteration of Apriori allows the miner to guide rule extraction by exploring the space of itemsets. Miners can discard itemsets considered not relevant and define clusters of related itemsets to perform rule filtering, so that uninteresting rules are removed while preserving itemset coverage in the resulting rule set. This reduced set provides a starting point to explore the rule space with an interface that supports pairwise comparisons between rules, according to some defined criteria.

Generic XML-based framework for metadata portals,2008,2-s2.0-52049083890,"We present a generic and flexible framework for building geoscientific metadata portals independent of content standards for metadata and protocols. Data can be harvested with commonly used protocols (e.g., Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting) and metadata standards like DIF or ISO 19115. The new Java-based portal software supports any XML encoding and makes metadata searchable through Apache Lucene. Software administrators are free to define searchable fields independent of their type using XPath. In addition, by extending the full-text search engine (FTS) Apache Lucene, we have significantly improved queries for numerical and date/time ranges by supplying a new trie-based algorithm, thus, enabling high-performance space/time retrievals in FTS-based geo portals. The harvested metadata are stored in separate indexes, which makes it possible to combine these into different portals. The portal-specific Java API and web service interface is highly flexible and supports custom front-ends for users, provides automatic query completion (AJAX), and dynamic visualization with conventional mapping tools.

A new approach to exploratory analysis of system dynamics using SOM. Applications to industrial processes,2008,2-s2.0-38649142784,"The self-organizing map (SOM) constitutes a powerful method for exploratory analysis of process data that is based on the so-called dimension reduction approach. The SOM algorithm defines a smooth non-linear mapping from a high-dimensional input space onto a low-dimensional output space (typically 2D) that preserves the most significant information about the input data distribution. This mapping can be used to obtain 2D representations (component planes, u-matrix, etc.) of the process variables that reveal the main static relationships, allowing to exploit available data and process-related knowledge in an efficient way for supervision and optimization purposes. In this work we present a complementary methodology to represent also the process dynamics in the SOM visualization, using maps in which every point represents a local dynamical behavior of the process and that, in addition, are consistent with the component planes of the process variables. The proposed methodology allows in this way to find relationships between the process variables and the process dynamics, opening important ways for the exploratory analysis of the dynamic behavior in non-linear and non-stationary processes. Experimental results from real data of two different industrial processes are also described, showing the possibilities of the proposed approach. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Visualization of patent analysis for emerging technology,2008,2-s2.0-37448998621,"Many methods have been developed to recognize those progresses of technologies, and one of them is to analyze patent information. And visualization methods are considered to be proper for representing patent information and its analysis results. However, current visualization methods for patent analysis patent maps have some drawbacks. Therefore, we propose an alternative visualization method in this paper. With colleted keywords from patent documents of a target technology field, we cluster patent documents by the k-Means algorithm. With the clustering results, we form a semantic network of keywords without respect of filing dates. And then we build up a patent map by rearranging each keyword node of the semantic network according to its earliest filing date and frequency in patent documents. Our approach contributes to establishing a patent map which considers both structured and unstructured items of a patent document. Besides, differently from previous visualization methods for patent analysis, ours is based on forming a semantic network of keywords from patent documents. And thereby it visualizes a clear overview of patent information in a more comprehensible way. And as a result of those contributions, it enables us to understand advances of emerging technologies and forecast its trend in the future. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Debugging strategies and tactics in a multi-representation software environment,2007,2-s2.0-35148829422,"This paper investigates the interplay between high level debugging strategies and low level tactics in the context of a multi-representation software development environment (SDE). It investigates three questions. 1. How do programmers integrate debugging strategies and tactics when working with SDEs? 2. What is the relationship between verbal ability, level of graphical literacy and debugging (task) performance. 3. How do modality and perspective influence debugging strategy and deployment of tactics? The paper extends the work of Katz and Anderson [1988. Debugging: an analysis of bug location strategies. Human-Computer Interaction 3, 359-399] and others in terms of identifying high level debugging strategies, in this case when working with SDEs. It also describes how programmers of different backgrounds and degrees of experience make differential use of the multiple sources of information typically available in a software debugging environment. Individual difference measures considered among the participants were their programming experience and their knowledge of external representation formalisms. The debugging environment enabled the participants, computer science students, to view the execution of a program in steps and provided them with concurrently displayed, adjacent, multiple and linked programming representations. These representations comprised the program code, two visualisations of the program and its output. The two visualisations of the program were available, in either a largely textual format or a largely graphical format so as to track interactions between experience and low level mode-specific tactics, for example. The results suggest that (i) additionally to deploying debugging strategies similar to those reported in the literature, participants also employed a strategy specific to SDEs, following execution, (ii) verbal ability was not correlated with debugging performance, (iii) knowledge of external representation formalisms was as important as programming experience to succeed in the debugging task, and (iv) participants with greater experience of both programming and external representation formalisms, unlike the less experienced, were able to modify their debugging strategies and tactics effectively when working under different format conditions (i.e. when working with either largely graphical or largely textual visualisations) in order to maintain their high debugging accuracy level. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

An empirical evaluation of four data visualization techniques for displaying short news text similarities,2007,2-s2.0-34548403424,"An experiment was conducted comparing user performance on four data visualization techniques-an unstructured display condition consisting of a random one-dimensional (1D) list and three proximity-based representations including a 1D list ranked by a greedy nearest-neighbor algorithm and two 2D spatial visualizations using the ISOMAP layout algorithm and multidimensional scaling (MDS). Eighty-one participants completed an information retrieval task where the visualization techniques were used to display a corpus consisting of 50 short news texts. Human pairwise similarity judgments for this corpus were used to create the three proximity-based displays. Results demonstrated an advantage in accuracy, the number of documents accessed, and, to a lesser extent, subjective confidence in these displays over the Random List condition and in the 2D over the 1D displays. Similar, but smaller, advantages were observed in the MDS display over ISOMAP however none of these pairwise comparisons were statistically significant. A sequential analysis of participant actions in terms of the proximity of document representations accessed provided some explanation for variations in performance between the displays as well as indicating strategic differences in interactions particularly between visualizations of different dimensionality.

Therefore, the need for time series data mining tool has become extremely important. The purpose of this paper is to provide a novel pattern in mining architecture with mixed attributes that uses a systematic approach in the financial database information mining.

Natural language processing and visualization in the molecular imaging domain,2007,2-s2.0-34248389664,"Molecular imaging is at the crossroads of genomic sciences and medical imaging. Information within the molecular imaging literature could be used to link to genomic and imaging information resources and to organize and index images in a way that is potentially useful to researchers. A number of natural language processing (NLP) systems are available to automatically extract information from genomic literature. One existing NLP system, known as BioMedLEE, automatically extracts biological information consisting of biomolecular substances and phenotypic data. This paper focuses on the adaptation, evaluation, and application of BioMedLEE to the molecular imaging domain. In order to adapt BioMedLEE for this domain, we extend an existing molecular imaging terminology and incorporate it into BioMedLEE. BioMedLEE's performance is assessed with a formal evaluation study. The system's performance, measured as recall and precision, is 0.74 (95% CI: [.70-.76]) and 0.70 (95% CI [.63-.76]), respectively. We adapt a JAVA™ viewer known as PGviewer for the simultaneous visualization of images with NLP extracted information. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Direct classification of high-dimensional data in low-dimensional projected feature spaces-Comparison of several classification methodologies,2007,2-s2.0-33847677992,"Previously, we introduced a distance (similarity)-based mapping for the visualization of high-dimensional patterns and their relative relationships. The mapping preserves exactly the original distances from all points to any two reference patterns in a special two-dimensional coordinate system, the relative distance plane (RDP). We extend the RDP mapping's applicability from visualization to classification. Several of the classifiers use the RDP directly. These include the standard linear discriminant analysis (LDA), nearest neighbor classifiers, and a transvariation probabilities-based classification method that is natural in the RDP. Several reference directions can also be combined to create new coordinate systems in which arbitrary classifiers can be developed. We obtain increased confidence in the classification results by cycling through all possible reference pairs and computing a misclassification-based weighted accuracy. The classification results on several high-dimensional biomedical datasets are compared. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Visualizing distortions and recovering topology in continuous projection techniques,2007,2-s2.0-33847360579,"The visualization of continuous multi-dimensional data based on their projection to a 2-dimensional space is a way to detect visually interesting patterns, as far as the projection provides a faithful image of the original data. In order to evaluate this faithfulness, we propose to visualize any measure associated to a projected datum or to a pair of projected data, by coloring the corresponding Voronoï cell in the projection space. We also define specific measures and show how they allow estimating visually whether some part of the projection is or is not a reliable image of the original manifolds. It also helps to figure out what the original topology of the data is, telling where the high-dimensional manifolds have been torn or glued during the projection. We experiment these techniques with the principal component analysis and the curvilinear component analysis applied to artificial and real databases. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Terminology model discovery using natural language processing and visualization techniques,2006,2-s2.0-33750698984,"Medical terminologies are important for unambiguous encoding and exchange of clinical information. The traditional manual method of developing terminology models is time-consuming and limited in the number of phrases that a human developer can examine. In this paper, we present an automated method for developing medical terminology models based on natural language processing (NLP) and information visualization techniques. Surgical pathology reports were selected as the testing corpus for developing a pathology procedure terminology model. The use of a general NLP processor for the medical domain, MedLEE, provides an automated method for acquiring semantic structures from a free text corpus and sheds light on a new high-throughput method of medical terminology model development. The use of an information visualization technique supports the summarization and visualization of the large quantity of semantic structures generated from medical documents.

Visual exploration of genetic likelihood space,2006,2-s2.0-33751058763,"Linkage analysis is used to localize human disease genes on the genome and it can involve the exploration and interpretation of a seven-dimensional genetic likelihood space. Existing genetic likelihood exploration techniques are quite cumbersome and slow, and do not help provide insight into the shape and features of the high-dimensional likelihood surface. The objective of our visualization is to provide an efficient visual exploration of the complex genetic likelihood space so that researchers can assimilate more information in the least possible time. In this paper, we present new visualization tools for interactive and efficient exploration of the multi-dimensional likelihood space. Our tools provide interactive manipulation of active ranges of the six model parameters determining the dependent variable, scaled genetic likelihood, or HLOD. Using filtering, color, and an approach inspired by ""worlds-within-worlds"" [5, 6], researchers can quickly obtain a more informative and insightful visual interpretation of the space.

Studying information seeking on the non-English Web: An experiment on a Spanish business Web portal,2006,2-s2.0-33745659248,"The Internet is estimated to grow significantly as access to Web content in some non-English languages continues to increase. However, prior research in human-computer interaction (HCI) has implicitly assumed the primary language used on the Web to be English. This assumption is not true for many non-English-speaking regions where rapidly growing on-line populations access the Web in their native languages. For example, Latin America, where the majority of people speak Spanish, will have the fastest growing population in coming decades. However, existing Spanish search engines lack search, browse, and analysis capabilities. The research reported here studied human information seeking on the non-English Web. In it we developed a Spanish business Web portal that supports searching, browsing, summarization, categorization, and visualization of Spanish business Web pages. Using 42 Spanish speakers as subjects we conducted a two-phase experiment to evaluate this portal and found that, compared with a Spanish search engine and a Spanish Web directory, it achieved significantly better user ratings on information quality, cross-regional search capability, system performance attributes, and overall satisfaction. Subjects' verbal comments strongly favored the search and browse functionality and user interface of our portal. As the Web becomes more international, this research makes three contributions: (1) an empirical evaluation of the performance level of a Spanish search portal; (2) an examination of the information quality, cross-regional search capability and usability of search engines for the non-English Web; and (3) a better understanding of non-English Web searching. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Practical evaluations of real user company needs for visualization technologies,2006,2-s2.0-29244451054,"The use of visualization technologies by the automotive industry is primarily aimed at increasing competitive advantage. Within the VIEW of the Future project (IST-2000-26089), two automotive companies, PSA Peugeot Citroën and Volvo Technology Corporation, had a need for targeted evaluation of practical issues in their potential use of VR/VE technology. PSA Peugeot Citroën would like to use visualization technology to accelerate and increase the efficiency of their product design cycle. A series of short experiments were conducted to enable PSA Peugeot Citroën to define the technological specifications of a CAVE-type system they would be purchasing to achieve their design goals. The results documented the fidelity of the visualization environment and user experience of the different configuration set-ups. For example, although passive stereo offered more brightness and better representation of colours, PSA Peugeot Citroën employees preferred active stereo due to the distracting ghosting effect present when using passive stereo. Thus PSA Peugeot Citroën chose to implement active stereo in their new system. There is a need for the engineers at the Volvo product companies to present more realistic vehicle components, e.g. car interior parts, in early product development phases. It is not known if the present computer graphics technology can represent vehicle components with high realism in practical applications. In the study reported here, we investigated the perception of visual appearance of virtual surface materials as well as real material samples by Volvo engineers. There was a general loss of information in the VE material representations, e.g. in terms of depth and colour information resulting in dull images. Further research needs to be conducted to examine different methods of producing virtual materials and compare the differently generated virtual materials, in addition to assessing their realism using different types of display technology. This would enable us to find the best method of virtual material production in conjunction with a system which best displays these virtual representations. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

"Evaluation of virtual reality products and applications from individual, organizational and societal perspectives - The ""VIEW"" case study",2006,2-s2.0-29244490063,"Virtual reality (VR) has evolved in technology and applications within the last decade. Technical advances have led to the development of novel interaction devices, interaction concepts, more reliable and robust VR set-ups, advanced visualization and modeling software. However, decisions regarding which VR set-ups and devices are suitable for particular applications are becoming more difficult due to the rapid stream of technical development. In the ""VIEW of the Future"" project (IST-2000-26089), the development process was coupled with an extensive and multivariable evaluation procedure. The latter has taken advantage of direct neurophysiological and psychophysiological measurements and a variety of self-report tools administered in a set of different but closely linked experiments. Furthermore, the implementation of VR solutions in different applications was examined with a socio-economic perspective, by applying a multi-criteria analysis (MCA) using an analytical hierarchical model. The data collected during the experimental trials enabled us to reach general conclusions regarding the systems used, and to derive applicability guidelines to facilitate the implementation of VR products. This paper presents all aspects of the evaluation methodology: Usability Test Battery for neuro- and psycho-physiological measurements, VIEW-IT heuristic assessment tool, questionnaires, MCA methodology).

Visualization and animation of state estimation performance,2005,2-s2.0-27544450057,"Reliable real time system ""visibility"" depends on a reliable and accurate state estimator. Present experience with state estimators indicates that its reliability is below expectations (an average of 5% non-convergent cases). The causes of this poor performance have been identified in earlier work by the authors and alternative robust state estimators have been proposed. For any state estimator, it is important to develop techniques for monitoring the performance of the state estimator and identification of potential problems such as bad sensors, consistent errors, modeling errors, etc. The paper presents visualization and animation methods that assist this process. It is demonstrated that bad data many times can be detected via visualization methods. The methodologies are demonstrated with a hybrid three-phase state estimator which addresses the issue of systematic errors from modeling and imbalance errors. This estimator is enhanced by visualization and animation methods that provide valuable information to users and system operators ""at a glance"".

The results from purely statistical methods, however, overlook relevant semantic features present within natural language and text-based information. Emerging research in ontology languages (e.g. RDF, RDFS, SUO-KIF, and OWL) offers promising avenues for overcoming these limitations by leveraging existing and future libraries of meta-data and semantic mark-up. Using semantic features (e.g. hypernyms, meronyms, synonyms, etc.) encoded in ontology languages, methods such as keyword search and clustering can be augmented to analyze and visualize documents at conceptually richer levels. We present findings from a hierarchical clustering system modified for ontological indexing and run on a topic-centric test collection of documents each with fewer than 200 words.

A novel visualization classifier and its applications,2005,2-s2.0-26944455173,"Classifiers, as one of the important tools of analyzing gene expression data in the post-genomic epoch, have been used widely in the classification of different cancer types in the past few years. Although most existing classifiers have high classification accuracy, the process of classification is a black box and they can not give biologists more information and interpretable results of classification. In this paper, we propose a novel visualization cancer classification method. Besides offering high classification accuracy, the method can help us identify complex disease-related genes and assess gene expression variation during the process of classification. The results of classification are natural and interpretable and the process of classification is visible. To evaluate the performance of the method we have applied the proposed method to three public data sets. The experimental results demonstrate that the approach is feasible and useful. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.",,"Second International Confernce on Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery, FSKD 2005",27 August 2005 through 29 August 2005,"Li J., Tang X.L., Li X.",7410071154;7404101300;35237863400;,"Li, J., Department of Computer Science and Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin 150001, China; Tang, X.L., Department of Computer Science and Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin 150001, China; Li, X., Department of Computer Science and Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin 150001, China, Department of Bioinformatics, Harbin Medical University, Harbin 150086, China",Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (Subseries of Lecture Notes in Computer Science),Lect Notes Artif Intell,2.0

Browsing a document collection represented in two- and three-dimensional virtual information space,2005,2-s2.0-19744377887,"This paper reports a study of information retrieval performance using an interface in which documents were represented by objects in a virtual environment. Spatial location was determined by semantic content, with inter-object distance representing semantic similarity of documents. The quality of spatial-semantic mapping was manipulated as was the number of dimensions (two versus three) in which document nodes were arranged. Participants were required to browse the information space and identify all documents relevant to a specified topic. Results indicated that participants were able to use three-dimensional spatial mapping of semantic information to facilitate task performance, with performance being better when the quality of the mapping was higher. Strategy differences were identified, with participants adopting a more 'exhaustive' approach when searching two-dimensional node arrangements, and a more 'focused' approach for three-dimensional arrangements. Cognitive ability was not strongly associated with task performance, but participants of relatively lower cognitive ability tended to out-perform those of higher cognitive ability in three-dimensional conditions. Possible reasons for these findings are discussed. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Evaluating event visualization: A usability study of COPLINK Spatio-Temporal Visualizer,2005,2-s2.0-10644268659,"Event visualization holds the promise of alleviating information overload in human analysis and numerous tools and techniques have been developed and evaluated. However, previous work does not specifically address either the coordination of event dimensions with the types of tasks involved or the way that visualizing different event dimensions can benefit human analysis. In this paper, we propose a taxonomy of event visualization and present a methodology for evaluating a coordinated event visualization tool called COPLINK Spatio-Temporal Visualizer (STV). The taxonomy encompasses various event dimensions, application domains, visualization metaphors, evaluation methods and performance measures. The evaluation methodology examines different event dimensions and different task types, thus juxtaposing two important elements of evaluating a tool. To achieve both internal and external validity, a laboratory experiment with students and a field study with crime analysis experts were conducted. Findings of our usability study show that STV could support crime analysis involving multiple, coordinated event dimensions as effectively as it could analyze individual, uncoordinated event dimensions. STV was significantly more effective and efficient than Microsoft Excel in performing coordinated tasks and was significantly more efficient in doing uncoordinated tasks related to temporal, spatial and aggregated information. Also, STV had compared favorably with Excel in completing uncoordinated tasks related to temporal and spatial information, respectively. Subjects' comments showed STV to be intuitive, useful and preferable to existing crime analysis methods. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Illustrative visualization,2005,2-s2.0-33749451048,"The tutorial presents state-of-the-art visualization techniques inspired by traditional technical and medical illustrations. Such techniques exploit the perception of the human visual system and provide effective visual abstractions to make the visualization clearly understandable. Visual emphasis and abstraction has been used for expressive presentation from prehistoric paintings to nowadays scientific and medical illustrations. Many of the expressive techniques used in art are adopted in computer graphics, and are denoted as illustrative or non-photorealistic rendering. Different stroke techniques, or brush properties express a particular level of abstraction. Feature emphasis or feature suppression is achieved by combining different abstraction levels in illustrative rendering. Challenges in visualization research are very large data visualization as well as multi-dimensional data visualization. To effectively convey the most important visual information there is a significant need for visual abstraction. For less relevant information the dedicated image space is reduced to enhance more prominent features. The discussed techniques in the context of scientific visualization are based on iso-surfaces and volume rendering. Apart from visual abstraction, i.e., illustrative representation, the visibility of prominent features can be achieved by illustrative visualization techniques such as cut-away views or ghosted views. The structures that occlude the most prominent information are suppressed in order to clearly see more interesting parts. A different smart way to provide information on the data is using exploded views or other types of deformation. Furthermore intuitive feature classification via 3D painting and manipulation with the classified data including label placement is presented. Discussed non-photorealistic and illustrative techniques from visualization and graphics are shown from the perspective as tools for illustrators from medicine, botany, archeology, and zoology. The limitations of existing NPR systems for science illustration are highlighted, and proposals for possible new directions are made. Illustrative visualization is demonstrated via application-specific tasks in medical visualization. An important aspect as compared to traditional medical illustrations is the interactivity and real-time manipulation of the acquired patient data. This can be very useful in anatomy education.

Visualization method for customer targeting using customer map,2005,2-s2.0-17844395462,"An important issue in customer-oriented marketing area is target selection which enables the determination of potential customers. In this paper, we suggest a novel customer targeting method: customer map for a service industry. The customer map is the visualization method for customer targeting. It depicts value distribution across customer needs and customer characteristics. To develop the customer map, we integrate numerous customer data from various data sources, perform data analyses using data mining techniques, and finally visualize the information derived by the former analyses. The customer map helps decision makers to build customer-oriented strategy under the unified goal of customer targeting. It also affords to monitor and perceive real time state and the change of customer value distribution based on their information without preconception. We apply the customer map to a credit card company, build web-based prototype system for the customer map and acquire managerial implications from this study. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Unsupervised recursive sequence processing,2005,2-s2.0-12144281716,"The self-organizing map (SOM) is a valuable tool for data visualization and data mining for potentially high-dimensional data of an a priori fixed dimensionality. We investigate SOMs for sequences and propose the SOM-S architecture for sequential data. Sequences of potentially infinite length are recursively processed by integrating the currently presented item and the recent map activation, as proposed in the SOMSD presented in (IEEE Trans.

We combine that approach with the hyperbolic neighborhood of Ritter (Proceedings of PKDD-01, Springer, Berlin, 2001, pp. 338-349), in order to account for the representation of possibly exponentially increasing sequence diversification over time. Discrete and real-valued sequences can be processed efficiently with this method, as we will show in experiments. Temporal dependencies can be reliably extracted from a trained SOM.

How to use the Kohonen algorithm to simultaneously analyze individuals and modalities in a survey,2005,2-s2.0-12144281715,"The Kohonen algorithm (SOM, Self-Organization and Associative Memory, Springer Series in Information Sciences, vol. 8, Springer, Berlin, 1984; Self-Organizing Maps, Springer Series in Information Science, vol. 30, Springer, Berlin, 1995) is a very powerful tool for data analysis. It was originally designed to model organized connections between some biological neural networks. It was also immediately considered as a very good algorithm to realize vectorial quantization, and at the same time pertinent classification, with nice properties for visualization. If the individuals are described by quantitative variables (ratios, frequencies, measurements, amounts, etc.), the straightforward application of the original algorithm leads to build code vectors and to associate to each of them the class of all the individuals which are more similar to this code-vector than to the others. But, in case of individuals described by categorical (qualitative) variables having a finite number of modalities (like in a survey), it is necessary to define a specific algorithm. In this paper, we present a new algorithm inspired by the SOM algorithm, which provides a simultaneous classification of the individuals and of their modalities. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

There is currently much excitement about the potential of these computer visualizations, particularly in education and training in science, technology and medicine.

Second their comprehension and use may depend on internal visualizations. Third, they might augment and be augmented by internal visualizations.

3D space framework for the multi-facet accessing of database records,2004,2-s2.0-26444518702,"This paper proposes a framework for the construction of a 3D information access space that supports users to intuitively access large amounts of information. To cope with a large set of database records, we need a dynamic method for organizing and accessing records through multiple different views, such as topological, temporal, categorical, hierarchical and alphabetical views. In the proposed information space architecture, each record is visualized together with its related views, called facets. Each facet is provided as a 3D window-like component that displays a relevant information space on its surface and works as an entrance gate to the space. Through facet components, we can catch a glimpse of more detailed or related information spaces. We can also access relevant records by diving into arbitrarily chosen one of these spaces.

Semantic technologies will make it possible to reason about the Web as if it was one extended knowledge base, thus offering increased precision when accessing information and the ability to locate information distributed across different web pages. Moreover, it will become possible to develop a range of educational semantic web services, such as interpretation or sensemaking, structure-visualization, support for argumentation, novel forms of content customization, novel mechanisms for aggregating learning material, and so on. In this paper we provide a framework to show how Semantic Browsers which use ontologies to identity important concepts in a document as a means of providing access to associated educational services can be used in conjunction with Knowledge Charts (ontologically permeated representations of a community's knowledge) in a process we call Knowledge Navigation as an important new resource for learning. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2004.",,14th International Conference EKAW 2004: Engineering Knowledge in the Age of the Semantic Web,5 October 2004 through 8 October 2004,"Stutt A., Motta E.",6602887467;7006092143;,"Stutt, A., Knowledge Media Institute, Open University, United Kingdom; Motta, E., Knowledge Media Institute, Open University, United Kingdom",Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (Subseries of Lecture Notes in Computer Science),Lect Notes Artif Intell,6.0
"Discovering, visualizing, and sharing knowledge through personalized learning knowledge maps",2004,2-s2.0-23144438514,"This paper presents an agent-based approach to semantic exploration and knowledge discovery in large information spaces by means of capturing, visualizing and making usable implicit knowledge structures of a group of users. The focus is on the developed conceptual model and system for creation and collaborative use of personalized learning knowledge maps. We use the paradigm of agents on the one hand as model for our approach, on the other hand it serves as a basis for an efficient implementation of the system. We present an unobtrusive model for profiling personalised user agents based on two dimensional semantic maps that provide 1) a medium of implicit communication between human users and the agents, 2) form of visual representation of resulting knowledge structures.

Data analysis of microarrays using SciCraft,2004,2-s2.0-22944446788,"SciCraft is a general open source data analysis tool which can be used in the analysis of microarrays. The main advantage of SciCraft is its ability to integrate different types of software through an intuitive and user friendly graphical interface. The user is able to control the flow of analysis and visualisation through a visual programming environment (VPE) where programs are drawn as diagrams. These diagrams consist of nodes and links where the nodes are methods or operators and the links are lines showing the flow of data between the nodes. The diagrammatic approach used in SciCraft is particularly suited to represent the various data analysis pipelines being used in the analysis of microarrays. Efficient integration of methods from different computer languages and programs is accomplished through various plug-ins that handle all the necessary communication and data format handling.

Multimodal phoneme recognition of meeting data,2004,2-s2.0-22944472097,"This paper describes experiments in automatic recognition of context-independent phoneme strings from meeting data using audio-visual features. Visual features are known to improve accuracy and noise robustness of automatic speech recognizers. However, many problems appear when not ""visually clean"" data is provided, such as data without limited variation in the speaker's frontal pose, lighting conditions, background, etc. The goal of this work was to test whether visual information can be helpful for recognition of phonemes using neural nets. While the audio part is fixed and uses standard Mel filter-bank energies, different features describing the video were tested: average brightness, DCT coefficients extracted from region-of-interest (ROI), optical flow analysis and lip-position features. The recognition was evaluated on a sub-set of IDIAP meeting room data.

The distance-similarity metaphor in network-display spatializations,2004,2-s2.0-18744386938,"Dimensionality reduction algorithms are applied in the field of information visualization to generate low-dimensional, visuo-spatial displays of complex, multivariate databases - spatializations. Most popular dimensionality reduction algorithms project relatedness in data content among entities in an information space (e.g., semantic similarity) onto some form of distance among the entities, such that semantically similar documents are placed closer to one another than less similar ones. In previous studies of point-display spatializations we have shown that people indeed associate metric straight-line inter-point distances with the semantic dissimilarity of documents depicted as points in two-dimensional space. In this paper we investigate the strategies viewers employ when conflicting notions of distance (straight-line metric vs. network metric vs. topological proximity) are jointly shown in a spatialized network display of Reuters news articles depicted as points connected by links. We report empirical results of an experiment where viewers are asked to assess document similarity, depending on various distance types. We also investigate how cartographic symbolization principles (the use of visual variables, such as size, color hue, and value) influence similarity judgments. These findings provide rare empirical evidence for generally accepted design practices within the cartographic community (e.g., the effects of visual variables). In addition, empirical results from this and related studies can be used to develop design guidelines for constructing cognitively adequate spatializations for knowledge discovery in very large databases. We conclude by presenting design guidelines for network spatializations within the context of cartographic practice and theory.",,,,"Fabrikant S.I., Montello D.R., Ruocco M., Middleton R.S.",14324591800;6603523125;8588692800;56377222000;,"Fabrikant, S.I., Department of Geography, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA 93106, United States; Montello, D.R., Department of Geography, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA 93106, United States; Ruocco, M., Department of Geography, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA 93106, United States; Middleton, R.S., Department of Geography, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA 93106, United States",Cartography and Geographic Information Science,Cartogr.

Mapping high-dimensional data onto a relative distance plane - An exact method for visualizing and characterizing high-dimensional patterns,2004,2-s2.0-5644298754,"We introduce a distance (similarity)-based mapping for the visualization of high-dimensional patterns and their relative relationships. The mapping preserves exactly the original distances between points with respect to any two reference patterns in a special two-dimensional coordinate system, the relative distance plane (RDP). As only a single calculation of a distance matrix is required, this method is computationally efficient, an essential requirement for any exploratory data analysis. The data visualization afforded by this representation permits a rapid assessment of class pattern distributions. In particular, we can determine with a simple statistical test whether both training and validation sets of a 2-class, high-dimensional dataset derive from the same class distributions. We can explore any dataset in detail by identifying the subset of reference pairs whose members belong to different classes, cycling through this subset, and for each pair, mapping the remaining patterns. These multiple viewpoints facilitate the identification and confirmation of outliers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on several complex biomedical datasets. Because of its efficiency, effectiveness, and versatility, one may use the RDP representation as an initial, data mining exploration that precedes classification by some classifier. Once final enhancements to the RDP mapping software are completed, we plan to make it freely available to researchers. Crown Copyright © 2004 Published by Elsevier Inc.

A high-dimensional approach to interactive graph visualization,2004,2-s2.0-2442472267,"Graph layout is an information visualization technology for illustrating relations between objects. Interactive graph layout is often important since it is difficult to statically lay out complex graphs such as general undirected graphs. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to interactive layout of general undirected graphs. The basic idea of our approach is to use static graph layouts in high-dimensional spaces to dynamically find two-dimensional layouts according to user interaction. The resulting method that we present exhibits the following two characteristics: (1) it efficiently updates two-dimensional graph layouts during user interaction; (2) it follows users' node dragging operations by actively moving other closely related nodes. Our method adopts eigenvector-based multidimensional scaling to compute high-dimensional graph layouts, and performs constraint satisfaction to determine appropriate two-dimensional planes onto which the high-dimensional layouts will be projected.",,Applied Computing 2004 - Proceedings of the 2004 ACM Symposium on Applied Computing,14 March 2004 through 17 March 2004,Hosobe H.,6603467197;,"Hosobe, H., National Institute of Informatics, 2-1-2 Hitotsubashi, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo 101-8430, Japan",Proceedings of the ACM Symposium on Applied Computing,Proc ACM Symp Appl Computing,11.0

VistaClara: An interactive visualization for exploratory analysis of DNA microarrays,2004,2-s2.0-2442606657,"We have created VistaClara to explore the effectiveness of applying an extended permutation matrix to the task of exploratory data analysis of multi-experiment microarray studies. The permutation matrix is a visualization technique for interactive exploratory analysis of tabular data that permits both row and column rearrangement, and fits well with the tabular forms of data characteristic of gene expression studies. However, this technique has been largely overlooked by current bioinformatics research. Our implementation supports direct incorporation of supplemental data and annotations into the matrix view. This enables visually searching for patterns in gene expression measurements that correlate with other types of relevant data (disease classes, clinical, histological, drug treatments, etc.). The heatmap visualization common in microarray analysis is extended to provide a novel alternative using size as well as color to graphically represent experimental values, thus allowing more effective quantitative comparisons. Methods to sort rows or columns by similarity extend the possible permutation operations, and allow more efficient searching for biologically relevant patterns in very large data sets. Based on overview+detail principles, a dynamic compressed heatmap view of the entire data set provides the user with overall context, including possible correlations not currently visible in the more detailed view.

Multidimensional support vector machines for visualization of gene expression data,2004,2-s2.0-2442451616,"DNA microarray technology has helped us to understand the biological system because of its ability to monitor the expression levels of thousands of genes simultaneously. Since DNA microarray experiments provide us with huge amount of gene expression data, they should be analyzed with statistical methods to extract the meanings of experimental results. For visualization and class prediction of gene expression data, we have developed a new SVM-based method called multidimensional SVMs, that generate multiple orthogonal axes. This method projects high dimensional data into lower dimensional space to exhibit properties of the data clearly and to visualize the distribution of the data roughly. Furthermore, the multiple axes can be used for class prediction. The basic properties of conventional SVMs are retained in our method: solutions of mathematical programming are sparse, the optimal solutions can always be found due to its convexity, and nonlinear classification is implemented implicitly through the use of kernel functions. The application of our method to the experimentally obtained gene expression datasets for patients' samples indicates that our algorithm is efficient and useful for visualization and class prediction.",,Applied Computing 2004 - Proceedings of the 2004 ACM Symposium on Applied Computing,14 March 2004 through 17 March 2004,"Komura D., Nakamura H., Tsutsumi S., Aburatani H., Ihara S.",8634071800;55624477955;35408216500;7005377301;56276013300;,"Komura, D., Res.

In the database task, participants were provided with a choice of information-equivalent data representations and chose one of them to use in answering database queries. A range of database tasks were posed to participants - some required the identification of unique entities, some required the detection of clusters of similar entities, and some involved the qualitative comparison of values, etc. Participants were divided, post hoc, into two groups on the basis of a pre-experimental task (card sort) designed to assess 'knowledge of external representations' (KER). Results showed that low and high KER groups differed most in terms of representation selection on cluster type database query tasks. Participants in the low group tended to change from more 'graphical' representations such as scatterplots to less complex representations (like bar charts or tables) from early to late trials. In contrast, high KER participants were able to successfully use a wider range of ER types.

Formal concept analysis for knowledge discovery and data mining: The new challenges,2004,2-s2.0-9444248155,"Data mining (DM) is the extraction of regularities from raw data, which are further transformed within the wider process of knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) into non-trivial facts intended to support decision making.

As a first step in the projected FCA expansion, we discuss the existing ARM methods, provide a set of guidelines for the design of novel ones, and list some open algorithmic issues on the FCA side. As an illustration, we propose two on-line methods computing the minimal generators of a closure system. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2004.",Springer Verlag,"2nd International Conference on Formal Concept Analysis, ICFCA 2004",23 February 2004 through 26 February 2004,"Valtchev P., Missaoui R., Godin R.",6603375221;6701456715;7003436190;,"Valtchev, P., DIRO, Université de Montréal, Montréal, QC, Canada; Missaoui, R., Département D'informatique et D'ingénierie, UQO, Gatineau, QC, Canada; Godin, R., Département D'informatique, UQAM, Montréal, QC, Canada",Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (Subseries of Lecture Notes in Computer Science),Lect Notes Artif Intell,126.0

Now that lattices can be created by software, it is important to have software that can automatically draw them.

Simulating the emotion dynamics of a multimodal conversational agent,2004,2-s2.0-9444274134,"We describe an implemented system for the simulation and visualisation of the emotional state of a multimodal conversational agent called Max. The focus of the presented work lies on modeling a coherent course of emotions over time. The basic idea of the underlying emotion system is the linkage of two interrelated psychological concepts: an emotion axis representing short-time system states and an orthogonal mood axis that stands for an undirected, longer lasting system state. A third axis was added to realize a dimension of boredom. To enhance the believability and lifelikeness of Max, the emotion system has been integrated in the agent's architecture. In result, Max's facial expression, gesture, speech, and secondary behaviors as well as his cognitive functions are modulated by the emotional system that, in turn, is affected by information arising at various levels within the agent's architecture. © 2004 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Springer Verlag,"Tutorial and Research Workshop on Affective Dialogue Systems, ADS 2004",14 June 2004 through 16 June 2004,"Becker C., Kopp S., Wachsmuth I.",57214067149;35722438500;35581983300;,"Becker, C., Artificial Intelligence Group, Faculty of Technology, University of Bielefeld, Bielefeld, D-33594, Germany; Kopp, S., Artificial Intelligence Group, Faculty of Technology, University of Bielefeld, Bielefeld, D-33594, Germany; Wachsmuth, I., Artificial Intelligence Group, Faculty of Technology, University of Bielefeld, Bielefeld, D-33594, Germany",Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (Subseries of Lecture Notes in Computer Science),Lect Notes Artif Intell,70.0
User profiling with privacy: A framework for adaptive information agents,2003,2-s2.0-15544367468,"This paper presents a framework for personal agents that respect the privacy of the individual. We present some motivations and outline a framework for the use of personal agents and user profiling for information systems designed around web services. A key element of our approach in general is to consider the impact of user-profiling and autonomous agents on the user. One particular aspect, which we explore in this paper, is the need to respect user's privacy. One often-cited benefit of using personal agents is for personalising interaction. However, personalisation and privacy have contradictory goals in disclosing personal information. We explore some elements of our framework that allow the user to control the trade-offs around disclosure of personal information.

Visualizing class probability estimators,2003,2-s2.0-9444222046,"Inducing classifiers that make accurate predictions on future data is a driving force for research in inductive learning. However, also of importance to the users is how to gain information from the models produced. Unfortunately, some of the most powerful inductive learning algorithms generate ""black boxes"" - that is, the representation of the model makes it virtually impossible to gain any insight into what has been learned. This paper presents a technique that can help the user understand why a classifier makes the predictions that it does by providing a two-dimensional visualization of its class probability estimates. It requires the classifier to generate class probabilities but most practical algorithms are able to do so (or can be modified to this end).",,7th European Conference on Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases,22 September 2003 through 26 September 2003,"Frank E., Hall M.",7202332302;55017043700;,"Frank, E., Department of Computer Science, University of Waikato, Hamilton, New Zealand; Hall, M., Department of Computer Science, University of Waikato, Hamilton, New Zealand",Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (Subseries of Lecture Notes in Computer Science),Lect Notes Artif Intell,12.0
Pushing the limit in visual data exploration: Techniques and applications,2003,2-s2.0-9444248604,"With the rapid growth in size and number of available databases, it is necessary to explore and develop new methods for analysing the huge amounts of data.

Automatic document categorization interpreting the perfomance of clustering algorithms,2003,2-s2.0-9444285495,"Clustering a document collection is the current approach to automatically derive underlying document categories. The categorization performance of a document clustering algorithm can be captured by the F-Measure, which quantifies how close a human-defined categorization has been resembled. However, a bad F-Measure value tells us nothing about the reason why a clustering algorithm performs poorly. Among several possible explanations the most interesting question is the following: Are the implicit assumptions of the clustering algorithm admissible with respect to a document categorization task? Though the use of clustering algorithms for document categorization is widely accepted, no foundation or rationale has been stated for this admissibility question. The paper in hand is devoted to this gap. It presents considerations and a measure to quantify the sensibility of a clustering process with regard to geometric distortions of the data space. Along with the method of multidimensional scaling, this measure provides an instrument for accessing a clustering algorithm's adequacy.",,"26th Annual German Conference on AI, KI 2003",15 September 2003 through 18 September 2003,"Stein B., Zu Eissen S.M.",23013265500;6505754317;,"Stein, B., Paderborn University, Department of Computer Science, D-33095 Paderborn, Germany; Zu Eissen, S.M., Paderborn University, Department of Computer Science, D-33095 Paderborn, Germany",Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (Subseries of Lecture Notes in Computer Science),Lect Notes Artif Intell,14.0

"Visualization, Optimization, and Business Strategy: A Case Study",2003,2-s2.0-0242507587,"We describe a visualization application intended for operational use in formulating business strategy in the customer service arena. The visualization capability provided in this application implicitly allows the user to better formulate the objective function for large optimization runs which act to minimize costs based on certain input parameters. Visualization is necessary because many of the inputs to the optimization runs are themselves strategic business decisions which are not pre-ordained. Both information visualization presentations and three-dimensional visualizations are included to help users better understand the cost/benefit tradeoffs of these strategic business decisions. Here, visualization explicitly provides value not possible algorithmically, as the perceived benefit of different combinations of service level does not have an a priori mathematical formulation. Thus we take advantage of the fundamental power of visualization, bringing the user's intuition and pattern recognition skills into the solution, while simultaneously taking advantage of the strength of algorithmic approaches to quickly and accurately find an optimal solution to a well-defined problem.",,VIS 2003 PROCEEDINGS,19 October 2003 through 24 October 2003,"Gresh D.L., Kelton E.I.",6603360261;6508284776;,"Gresh, D.L., IBM T.J.

Reaction forces are generated by a spring coupler between the proxy and the data probe, which can be tuned to the capabilities of the haptic interface. Secondary haptic effects including field forces, friction, and texture can be easily incorporated to convey information about additional characteristics of the data.

Spatialization methods: A cartographic research agenda for non-geographic information visualization,2003,2-s2.0-0043204296,"Information visualization is an interdisciplinary research area in which cartographic efforts have mostly addressed the handling of geographic information. Some cartographers have recently become involved in attempts to extend geographic principles and cartographic techniques to the visualization of non-geographic information. This paper reports on current progress and future opportunities in this emerging research field commonly known as spatialization. The discussion is mainly devoted to the computational techniques that turn high-dimensional data into visualizations via processes of projection and transformation. It is argued that cartographically informed engagement of computationally intensive techniques can help to provide richer and less apaque information visualizations. The discussion of spatialization methods is linked to another priority area of cartographic involvement, the development of theory and principles for cognitively plausible spatialization. The paper distinguishes two equally important sets of challenges for cartographic success in spatialization research. One is the recognition that there are distinct advantages to applying a cartographic perspective in information visualization. This requires our community to more thoroughly understand the essence of cartographic activity and to explore the implications of its metaphoric transfer to non-geographic domains. Another challenge lies in cartographers becoming a more integral part of the information visualization community and actively engaging its constituent research fields.",,,,"Skupin A., Fabrikant S.I.",6603373023;14324591800;,"Skupin, A., Department of Geography, University of New Orleans, New Orleans, LA 70148, United States; Fabrikant, S.I., Department of Geography, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA 93106, United States",Cartography and Geographic Information Science,Cartogr.

Visualizations of binary data: A comparative evaluation,2003,2-s2.0-0242303036,"Data visualization has the potential to assist humans in analysing and comprehending large volumes of data, and to detect patterns, clusters and outliers that are not obvious using non-graphical forms of presentation. For this reason, data visualizations have an important role to play in a diverse range of applied problems, including data exploration and mining, information retrieval, and intelligence analysis. Unfortunately, while various different approaches are available for data visualization, there have been few rigorous evaluations of their effectiveness. This paper presents the results of three controlled experiments comparing the ability of four different visualization approaches to help people answer meaningful questions for binary data sets. Two of these visualizations, Chernoff faces and star glyphs, represent objects using simple icon-like displays. The other two visualizations use a spatial arrangement of the objects, based on a model of human mental representation, where more similar objects are placed nearer each other. One of these spatial displays uses a common features model of similarity, while the other uses a distinctive features model. The first experiment finds that both glyph visualizations lead to slow, inaccurate answers being given with low confidence, while the faster and more confident answers for spatial visualizations are only accurate when the common features similarity model is used. The second experiment, which considers only the spatial visualizations, supports this finding, with the common features approach again producing more accurate answers. The third experiment measures human performance using the raw data in tabular form, and so allows the usefulness of visualizations in facilitating human performance to be assessed. This experiment confirms that people are faster, more confident and more accurate when an appropriate visualization of the data is made available. © 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

Visualising the internal components of networks,2003,2-s2.0-7044273976,"Feed forward artificial neural networks (FFANN), trained by supervision, are useful modelling tools. Data models are developed by statistical regression of some measure of error in network performance over the period of training. The success of training can only be gauged after the testing phase. Valuable information concerning how a network develops a representative model, the act of modelling, is lost as only the final weight state of the network, the model, is considered relevant. A group of visualisation techniques are presented that allows network performance to be studied in real time, from any output perspective of any network component during the training phase.

A vocabulary development and visualization tool based on natural language processing and the mining of textual patient reports,2003,2-s2.0-0242690445,"Medical terminologies are critical for automated healthcare systems. Some terminologies, such as the UMLS and SNOMED are comprehensive, whereas others specialize in limited domains (i.e., BIRADS) or are developed for specific applications. An important feature of a terminology is comprehensive coverage of relevant clinical terms and ease of use by users, which include computerized applications. We have developed a method for facilitating vocabulary development and maintenance that is based on utilization of natural language processing to mine large collections of clinical reports in order to obtain information on terminology as expressed by physicians. Once the reports are processed and the terms structured and collected into an XML representational schema, it is possible to determine information about terms, such as frequency of occurrence, compositionality, relations to other terms (such as modifiers), and correspondence to a controlled vocabulary. This paper describes the method and discusses how it can be used as a tool to help vocabulary builders navigate through the terms physicians use, visualize their relations to other terms via a flexible viewer, and determine their correspondence to a controlled vocabulary. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

Introduction: Design and evaluation of notification user interfaces,2003,2-s2.0-0037666044,"Notification systems attempt to deliver current, important information to the computer screen in an efficient and effective manner. All notification systems require that the user attends to them to at least some degree if they are to succeed. Examples of notification systems include instant messaging systems, system and user status updates, email alerts and news and stock tickers. The benefits of notification systems are numerous, including rapid availability of important information, access to nearly instantaneous communication and heightened awareness of the availability of personal contacts. While the popularity of these systems has skyrocketed in recent years, the effects of incoming notifications on ongoing computing tasks have been relatively unexplored. The investigation of the costs, benefits and the optimal display of instant messages and all notifications in the context of desktop or mobile computing tasks falls in the general arena of psychological research on alerting and disruptions, but also requires research contributions from design, computer science and information visualization. To date, much of the psychological research on interruption leverages theoretical task constructions. In this special issue, we focus on the nature of interruptions such as messaging while computing and how to optimize the user experience. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Automation of the deep web with user defined behaviours,2003,2-s2.0-7044224310,"Giving semantics to Web data is an issue for automated Web navigation. Since legacy Web pages have been built using HTML as a visualization-oriented markup for years, data on the Web is suitable for people using browsers, but not for programs automatically performing a task on the Web on behalf of their users. The W3C Semantic Web initiative [16] tries to solve this by explicitly declaring semantic descriptions in (typically RDF [19] and OWL [23]) metadata associated to Web pages and ontologies combined with semantic rules. This way, inference-enabled agents may deduce which actions (links to be followed, forms to be filled,...) should be executed in order to retrieve the results for a user's query. However, something more than inferring how to retrieve information from the Web is needed to automate tasks on the Web. Information retrieval [3] is only the first step. Other actions like relevant data extraction, data homogeneization and user definable processing are needed as well for automating Web-enabled applications running on Web servers. This paper proposes two programming languages for instructing assistants about how to explore Web sites according to the user's aims, providing a real example from the legacy deep Web. © 2003 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Springer Verlag,"1st International Atlantic Web Intelligence Conference, AWIC 2003",5 May 2003 through 6 May 2003,"Centeno V.L., Kloos C.D., Breuer P.T., Fernandez L.S., Gonzalo Cabellos M.E., Pérez J.A.H.",55664996200;56997681300;7003378241;57197544832;57006795800;7403417783;,"Centeno, V.L., Departamento de Ingeniería Telemática, Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Avda.

PANGAEA - an information system for environmental sciences,2002,2-s2.0-0036888250,"PANGAEA is an information system for processing, long-term storage, and publication of georeferenced data related to earth science fields. Essential services supplied by PANGAEA are project data management and the distribution of visualization and analysis software. Organization of data management includes quality control and publication of data and the dissemination of metadata according to international standards. Data managers are responsible for acquisition and maintenance of data. The data model used reflect the information processing steps in the earth science fields and can handle any related analytical data. The basic technical structure corresponds to a three tiered client/server architecture with a number of comprehensive clients and middleware components controlling the information flow and quality. On the server side a relational database management system (RDBMS) is used for information storage. The web-based clients include a simple search engine (Panga Vista) and a data mining tool (ART). The client used for maintenance of information contents is optimized for data management purposes. Analysis and visualization of metainformation and analytical data is supported by a number of software tools, which can either be used as 'plug-ins' of the PANGAEA clients or as standalone applications, distributed as freeware from the PANGAEA website. Established and well-documented software tools are the mini-GIS PanMap, the plotting tool PanPlot, and Ocean Data View (ODV) for the exploration of oceanographic data. PANGAEA operates on a long-term basis. The available resources are sufficient not only for the acquisition of new data and the maintenance of the system but also for further technical and organizational developments. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Interactive analysis and visualization of geoscience data with Ocean Data View,2002,2-s2.0-0036883627,"Ocean Data View (ODV) is a freeware package for the interactive exploration and graphical display of multiparameter profile or sequence data. Although originally developed for oceanographic observations only, the underlying concept is more general, and data or model output from other areas of geosciences, like for instance geology, geophysics, geography and atmospheric research can be maintained and explored with ODV as well. The data format of ODV is designed for dense storage and direct data access, and allows the construction of very large datasets, even on affordable and portable hardware. ODV supports display of original data by colored dots or actual data values at the measurement locations. In addition, two fast and reliable variable-resolution gridding algorithms allow color shading and contouring of gridded fields along sections and on general 3D surfaces. A large number of derived quantities can be selected and calculated online. These variables are displayed and analyzed in the same way as the basic variables stored in disk files. ODV runs on PCs under Windows and on UNIX workstations under SUN Solaris. The software and extensive sets of coastline, topography, river-, lake- and border outlines as well as various gazetteers of topographic features are available at no cost over the Internet. In addition, the electronic atlas eWOCE that consists of oceanographic data from the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) is also available free of charge over the Internet. A gallery of prepared plots of property distributions along WOCE sections provides a quick overview over hydrographic, nutrient, oxygen and transient tracer fields in the ocean and, apart from the scientific use for oceanographic research, can serve as tutorial material for introductory or advanced courses on oceanography. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

A model for the visualization exploration process,2002,2-s2.0-0036448587,"The current state of the art in visualization research places a strong emphasis on different techniques to derive insight from disparate types of data. However, little work has investigated the visualization process itself. The information content of the visualization process-the results, history, and relationships between those results-is addressed by this work. A characterization of the visualization process is discussed, leading to a general model of the visualization exploration process. The model, based upon a new parameter derivation calculus, can be used for automated reporting, analysis, or visualized directly. An XML-based language for expressing visualization sessions using the model is also described. These sessions can then be shared and reused by collaborators. The model, along with the XML representation, provides an effective means to utilize the information within the visualization process to further data exploration.",,"VIS 2002, IEEE Visualisation 2002",27 October 2002 through 1 November 2002,"Jankun-Kelly T.J., Ma K.-L., Gertz M.",6507912264;35242602500;7102156267;,"Jankun-Kelly, T.J., Visualization and Graphics Res.

Combining sensory information to improve visualization,2002,2-s2.0-0036448618,"Seemingly effortlessly the human brain reconstructs the three-dimensional environment surrounding us from the light pattern striking the eyes. This seems to be true across almost all viewing and lighting conditions. One important factor for this apparent easiness is the redundancy of information provided by the sensory organs. For example, perspective distortions, shading, motion parallax, or the disparity between the two eyesí images are all, at least partly, redundant signals which provide us with information about the three-dimensional layout of the visual scene. Our brain uses all these different sensory signals and combines the available information into a coherent percept. In displays visualizing data, however, the information is often highly reduced and abstracted, which may lead to an altered perception and therefore a misinterpretation of the visualized data. In this panel we will discuss mechanisms involved in the combination of sensory information and their implications for simulations using computer displays, as well as problems resulting from current display technology such as cathode-ray tubes.",,"VIS 2002, IEEE Visualisation 2002",27 October 2002 through 1 November 2002,"Ernst M., Banks M., Wichmann F., Maloney L., Buelthoff H.",7201640221;7102259684;6603676955;7005595017;35511854700;,"Ernst, M., Max-Planck-Inst.

Assisted navigation for large information spaces,2002,2-s2.0-0036448606,"This paper presents a new technique for visualizing large, complex collections of data. The size and dimensionality of these datasets make them challenging to display in an effective manner. The images must show the global structure of spatial relationships within the dataset, yet at the same time accurately represent the local detail of each data element being visualized. We propose combining ideas from information and scientific visualization together with a navigation assistant, a software system designed to help users identify and explore areas of interest within their data. The assistant locates data elements of potential importance to the user, clusters them into spatial regions, and builds underlying graph structures to connect the regions and the elements they contain. Graph traversal algorithms, constraint-based viewpoint construction, and intelligent camera planning techniques can then be used to design animated tours of these regions. In this way, the navigation assistant can help users to explore any of the areas of interest within their data.

Kinetic visualization: A technique for illustrating 3D shape and structure,2002,2-s2.0-0036452293,"Motion provides strong visual cues for the perception of shape and depth, as demonstrated by cognitive scientists and visual artists. This paper presents a novel visualization technique - kinetic visualization - that uses particle systems to add supplemental motion cues which can aid in the perception of shape and spatial relationships of static objects. Based on a set of rules following perceptual and physical principles, particles flowing over the surface of an object not only bring out, but also attract attention to, essential information on the shape of the object that might not be readily visible with conventional rendering that uses lighting and view changes. Replacing still images with animations in this fashion, we demonstrate with both surface and volumetric models in the accompanying videos that in many cases the resulting visualizations effectively enhance the perception of three-dimensional shape and structure.

Footprints of information foragers: Behaviour semantics of visual exploration,2002,2-s2.0-0036704748,"Social navigation exploits the knowledge and experience of peer users of information resources. A wide variety of visual-spatial approaches become increasingly popular as a means to optimize information access as well as to foster and sustain a virtual community among geographically distributed users. An information landscape is among the most appealing design options of representing and communicating the essence of distributed information resources to users. A fundamental and challenging issue is how an information landscape can be designed such that it will not only preserve the essence of the underlying information structure, but also accommodate the diversity of individual users. The majority of research in social navigation has been focusing on how to extract useful information from what is in common between users' profiles, their interests and preferences. In this article, we explore the role of modelling sequential behaviour patterns of users in augmenting social navigation in thematic landscapes. In particular, we compare and analyse the trails of individual users in thematic spaces along with their cognitive ability measures. We are interested in whether such trails can provide useful guidance for social navigation if they are embedded in a visual-spatial environment. Furthermore, we are interested in whether such information can help users to learn from each other, for example, from the ones who have been successful in retrieving documents. In this article, we first describe how users' trails in sessions of an experimental study of visual information retrieval can be characterized by Hidden Markov Models. Trails of users with the most successful retrieval performance are used to estimate parameters of such models. Optimal virtual trails generated from the models are visualized and animated as if they were actual trails of individual users in order to highlight behavioural patterns that may foster social navigation. The findings of the research wilt provide direct input to the design of social navigation systems as well as to enrich theories of social navigation in a wider context. These findings will lead to the further development and consolidation of a tightly coupled paradigm of spatial, semantic and social navigation. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Tensor field visualisation using adaptive filtering of noise fields combined with glyph rendering,2002,2-s2.0-0036450492,"While many methods exist for visualising scalar and vector data, visualisation of tensor data is still troublesome. We present a method for visualising second order tensors in three dimensions using a hybrid between direct volume rendering and glyph rendering. An overview scalar field is created by using three-dimensional adaptive filtering of a scalar field containing noise. The filtering process is controlled by the tensor field to be visualised, creating patterns that characterise the tensor field. By combining direct volume rendering of the scalar field with standard glyph rendering methods for detailed tensor visualisation, a hybrid solution is created. A combined volume and glyph renderer was implemented and tested with both synthetic tensors and strain-rate tensors from the human heart muscle, calculated from phase contrast magnetic resonance image data. A comprehensible result could be obtained, giving both an overview of the tensor field as well as detailed information on individual tensors.",,"VIS 2002, IEEE Visualisation 2002",27 October 2002 through 1 November 2002,"Sigfridsson A., Ebbers T., Heiberg E., Wigström L.",21934864200;6603253440;8630845500;6701413981;,"Sigfridsson, A., Department of Medicine and Care, Linköpings Universitet, Linköpings, Sweden, Dept. of Med./Care, Clin.

The discussion concentrates on the formulation of a standard procedure that, using the concept of fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic, can define the likelihood of changes detected from remotely sensed data. The fuzzy visualization of areas undergoing changes can be incorporated into a decision support system for prioritization of areas requiring environmental monitoring. One of the main problems related to unsupervised change detection methods lies in the lack of efficient automatic techniques for discriminating between changed and unchanged pixels in the difference image. Such discrimination is usually performed by using empirical strategies or manual trial-and-error procedures, which affect both, the accuracy and the reliability of the change-detection process. To overcome such drawbacks, in this paper, we propose an automatic technique for the analysis of the difference image. Such technique allows the automatic selection of the decision threshold. We used a thresholding approach by performing fuzzy partition on a twodimensional (2-D) histogram, which included contextual information, based on fuzzy relation and maximum fuzzy entropy principle. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of proposed technique. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2002.",Springer Verlag,"8th Ibero-American Conference on Artificial Intelligence, IBERAMIA 2002",12 November 2002 through 15 November 2002,"Velloso M.L.F., De Souza F.J.",6602560091;7005069100;,"Velloso, M.L.F., Department of Electronics Engineering, Uerj-Rio de Janeiro State University, Rua São Francisco Xavier, 524, Rio de Janeiro, 20550-013, Brazil; De Souza, F.J., Department of Computer Engineering, Uerj-Rio de Janeiro State University, Rua São Francisco Xavier, 524, Rio de Janeiro, 20550-013, Brazil",Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (Subseries of Lecture Notes in Computer Science),Lect Notes Artif Intell,2.0
Exploratory navigation in large multimedia documents using Context Lenses,2002,2-s2.0-84900393699,"The Context Lens (CL) is a focus plus context visualization and navigation tool particularly suited for navigating large documents, or collections of documents. Context Lenses have been applied successfully to navigating Web pages, video collections and slide presentations. We discuss our experiences both with linear as well as with hierarchical Context Lenses. We focus on the use of information scent in the hierarchical Context Lens, and on supporting an exploratory navigation style in documents. Exploratory navigation is supported by the fact that a CL delays commitment in the user interface through an interaction style called brushing. Brushing lowers the cost of exploring a section of the document and therefore does not only support, but actively encourage an exploratory navigation style. This aspect of Context Lenses is especially valuable for navigation of large amounts of media data on low bandwidth devices, such as wireless PDA. © 2002 IEEE.",IEEE Computer Society,"35th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, HICSS 2002",7 January 2002 through 10 January 2002,"Dieberger A., Russell D.M.",6602803785;7403669974;,"Dieberger, A., IBM Almaden Research Center, USER Group, 650 Harry Road, San Jose, CA  95120, United States; Russell, D.M., IBM Almaden Research Center, USER Group, 650 Harry Road, San Jose, CA  95120, United States",Proceedings of the Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences,Proc.

Exploring surface characteristics with interactive Gaussian images (A case study),2002,2-s2.0-0036451129,"The Gauss map projects surface normals to a unit sphere, providing a powerful visualization of the geometry of a graphical object. It can be used to predict visual events caused by changes in lighting, shading, and camera control. We present an interactive technique for portraying the Gauss map of polygonal models, mapping surface normals and the magnitudes of surface curvature using a spherical projection. Unlike other visualizations of surface curvature, we create our Gauss map directly from polygonal meshes without requiring any complex intermediate calculations of differential geometry. For anything other than simple shapes, surface information is densely mapped into the Gaussian normal image, inviting the use of visualization techniques to amplify and emphasize details hidden within the wealth of data. We present the use of interactive visualization tools such as brushing and linking to explore the surface properties of solid shapes. The Gauss map is shown to be simple to compute, easy to view dynamically, and effective at portraying important features of polygonal models.",,"VIS 2002, IEEE Visualisation 2002",27 October 2002 through 1 November 2002,"Lowekamp B., Rheingans P., Yoo T.S.",14825420700;6603558032;7101746125;,"Lowekamp, B., Univ. of Maryland Baltimore County, Catonsville, MD, United States; Rheingans, P., Univ. of Maryland Baltimore County, Catonsville, MD, United States; Yoo, T.S., National Library of Medicine, Bethesda, MD, United States",Proceedings of the IEEE Visualization Conference,Proc IEEE Visual Conf,5.0

Monte Carlo localization in 3D maps using stereo vision,2002,2-s2.0-35248867050,"In this paper we present a Monte Carlo localization algorithm that exploits 3D information obtained by a trinocular stereo camera. First, we obtain a 3D map by estimating the optimal transformations between two consecutive views of the environment through the minimization of an energy function. Then, we use a particle-filter algorithm for addressing the localization in the map. For that purpose we define the likelihood of each sample as depending not only on the compatibility of its 3D perception with that of the observation, but also depending on its compatibility in terms of visual appearance. Our experimental results show the success of the algorithm both in easy and quite ambiguous settings, and they also show the speed-up in convergence when visual appearance is added to depth information. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2002.",Springer Verlag,"8th Ibero-American Conference on Artificial Intelligence, IBERAMIA 2002",12 November 2002 through 15 November 2002,"Sáez J.M., Escolano F.",7202171003;8727141600;,"Sáez, J.M., Robot Vision Group, Departamento de Ciencia de la Computación e Inteligencia Artificial, Universidad de Alicante, Spain; Escolano, F., Robot Vision Group, Departamento de Ciencia de la Computación e Inteligencia Artificial, Universidad de Alicante, Spain",Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (Subseries of Lecture Notes in Computer Science),Lect Notes Artif Intell,1.0
Detail and context in web usage mining: Coarsening and visualizing sequences,2002,2-s2.0-84943162743,"As Web sites begin to realize the advantages of engaging users in more extended interactions involving information and communication, the log files recording Web usage become more complex. While Web usage mining provides for the syntactic specification of structured patterns like association rules or (generalized) sequences, it is less clear how to analyze and visualize usage data involving longer patterns with little expected structure, without losing an overview of the whole of all paths. In this paper, concept hierarchies are used as a basic method of aggregating Web pages. Interval-based coarsening is then proposed as a method for representing sequences at different levels of abstraction. The tool STRATDYN that implements these methods uses χ2 testing and coarsened stratograms. Stratograms with uniform or differential coarsening provide various detail-and-context views of actual and intended Web usage. Relations to the measures support and confidence, and ways of analyzing generalized sequences are shown.

A naive application of this model leads to unsatisfactory results, hence it is tailored to suit our purposes better. Continuing branches are emphasized, long branches are contracted, and sets of leaves are shown as fruit. The method is applied to the visualization of directory structures.

Fast detection of meaningful isosurfaces for volume data visualization,2001,2-s2.0-0035175522,"Automatic detection of meaningful isosurfaces is important for producing informative visualizations of volume data, especially when no information about the data origin and imaging protocol is available. We propose a computationally efficient method for the automated detection of intensity transitions in volume data. In this approach, the dominant transitions correspond to clear maxima in cumulative Laplacian-weighted gray value histograms. Only one pass through the data volume is required to compute the histogram. Several other features which may be useful for exploration of data of unknown origin can be efficiently computed in a similar manner, e.g. enclosed volume, isosurface area, mean gradient. The detected intensity transitions can be used for setting of visualization parameters for surface rendering, as well as for direct volume rendering of 3-D datasets. When using surface rendering, the detected dominant intensity transition values correspond to the optimal surface isovalues for extraction of boundaries of the objects of interest. In direct volume rendering, such transitions are important for generation of the transfer functions, which are used to assign visualization properties to data voxels and determine the appearance of the rendered image. The proposed method is illustrated by examples with synthetic data as well as real biomedical datasets.",,Visualization 2001,21 October 2001 through 26 October 2001,"Pekar V., Wiemker R., Hempel D.",6603564615;6602732973;7006748239;,"Pekar, V., Philips Research Laboratories, Hamburg, Germany; Wiemker, R., Philips Research Laboratories, Hamburg, Germany; Hempel, D., Philips Research Laboratories, Hamburg, Germany",Proceedings of the IEEE Visualization Conference,Proc IEEE Visual Conf,50.0

Pixel bar charts: A new technique for visualizing large multi-attribute data sets without aggregation,2001,2-s2.0-0035193964,"Simple presentation graphics are intuitive and easy-to-use, but show only highly aggregated data and present only a very limited number of data values (as in the case of bar charts). In addition, these graphics may have a high degree of overlap which may occlude a significant portion of the data values (as in the case of the x-y plots). In this paper, we therefore propose a generalization of traditional bar charts and x-y plots which allows the visualization of large amounts of data. The basic idea is to use the pixels within the bars to present the detailed information of the data records. Our so-called pixel bar charts retain the intuitiveness of traditional bar charts while allowing very large data sets to be visualized in an effective way. We show that, for an effective pixel placement, we have to solve complex optimization problems, and present an algorithm which efficiently solves the problem.

IJADE eMiner - A web-based mining agent based on intelligent Java agent development environment (iJADE) on internet shopping,2001,2-s2.0-84942857011,"With the rapid growth of e-commerce applications, Internet shopping is becoming part of our daily lives. Traditional Web-based product searching based on keywords searching seems insufficient and inefficient in the 'sea' of information. In this paper, we propose an innovative intelligent multi-agent based environment, namely (iJADE) - intelligent Java Agent Development Environment - to provide an integrated and intelligent agent-based platform in the e-commerce environment. In addition to contemporary agent development platforms, which focus on the autonomy and mobility of the multi-agents, iJADE provides an intelligent layer (known as the 'conscious layer') to implement various AI functionalities in order to produce 'smart' agents. From the implementation point of view, iJADE eMiner consists of two main modules: 1) a visual data mining and visualization system for automatic facial authentication based on the FAgent model, and 2) a fuzzy-neural based shopping agent (FShopper) to facilitate Web-mining on Internet shopping in cyberspace. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2001.",Springer Verlag,"5th Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, PAKDD 2001",16 April 2001 through 18 April 2001,"Lee R.S.T., Liu J.N.K.",9235108000;55851927700;,"Lee, R.S.T., Department of Computing, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hung Hom, Hong Kong; Liu, J.N.K., Department of Computing, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hung Hom, Hong Kong",Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (Subseries of Lecture Notes in Computer Science),Lect Notes Artif Intell,11.0
A new tree-structured self-organizing map for data analysis,2001,2-s2.0-0034875081,"Self-organizing map has been applied to a variety of tasks including data visualization and clustering. Once the point density of the neurons approximates the density of data, it is possible to miner clustering information from the data set after its unsupervised learning by using the neuron's relations. This paper presents a new algorithm for dynamical generation of a hierarchical structure of self-organizing maps with applications to data analysis. Differently from other tree-structured SOM approaches, which nodes are neurons, in this case the tree nodes are actually maps. From top to down, maps are automatically segmented by using the U-matrix information, which presents relations between neighboring neurons. The automatic map partitioning algorithm is based on mathematical morphology segmentation and it is applied to each map in each level of the hierarchy. Clusters of neurons are automatically identified and labeled and generate new sub-maps. Data are partitioned accordingly the label of its best match unit in each level of the tree. The algorithm may be seen as a recursive partition clustering method with multiple prototypes cluster representation, which enables the discoveries of clusters in a variety of geometrical shapes.",,International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN'01),15 July 2001 through 19 July 2001,"Costa J.A.F., De Andrade Netto M.L.",7402460809;6603394469;,"Costa, J.A.F., Dept. of Comp.

Ordered treemap layouts,2001,2-s2.0-0035193714,"Treemaps, a space-filling method of visualizing large hierarchical data sets, are receiving increasing attention. Several algorithms have been proposed to create more useful displays by controlling the aspect ratios of the rectangles that make up a treemap. While these algorithms do improve visibility of small items in a single layout, they introduce instability over time in the display of dynamically changing data, and fail to preserve an ordering of the underlying data. This paper introduces the ordered treemap, which addresses these two shortcomings. The ordered treemap algorithm ensures that items near each other in the given order will be near each other in the treemap layout. Using experimental evidence from Monte Carlo trials, we show that compared to other layout algorithms ordered treemaps are more stable while maintaining relatively favorable aspect ratios of the constituent rectangles.

Visualizing 2D probability distributions from EOS satellite image-derived data sets: A case study,2001,2-s2.0-0035163048,"Maps of biophysical and geophysical variables using Earth Observing System (EOS) satellite image data are an important component of Earth science. These maps have a single value derived at every grid cell and standard techniques are used to visualize them. Current tools fall short, however, when it is necessary to describe a distribution of values at each grid cell. Distributions may represent a frequency of occurrence over time, frequency of occurrence from multiple runs of an ensemble forecast or possible values from an uncertainty model. We identify these ""distribution data sets"" and present a case study to visualize such 2D distributions. Distribution data sets are different from multivariate data sets in the sense that the values are for a single variable instead of multiple variables. Data for this case study consists of multiple realizations of percent forest cover, generated using a geostatistical technique that combines ground measurements and satellite imagery to model uncertainty about forest cover. We present two general approaches for analyzing and visualizing such data sets. The first is a pixel-wise analysis of the probability density functions for the 2D image while the second is an analysis of features identified within the image. Such pixel-wise and feature-wise views will give Earth scientists a more complete understanding of distribution data sets.

From metaphor to method: cartographic perspectives on information visualization,2000,2-s2.0-0034497533,"By virtue of their spatio-cognitive abilities, humans are able to navigate through geographic space as well as meaningfully communicate geographic information represented in cartographic form. The current dominance of spatial metaphors in information visualization research is the result of the realization that those cognitive skills also have value in the exploration and analysis of non-geographic information. While mapping or landscape metaphors are routinely used in this field, there is a noticeable lack of consideration for existing cartographic expertise. This is especially apparent whenever problematic issues are encountered, such as graphic complexity or feature labeling. There are a number of areas in which a cartographic outlook could provide a valuable perspective. This paper discusses how geographic and cartographic notions may influence the design of visualizations for textual information spaces.

Taxonomy of visualization techniques using the data state reference model,2000,2-s2.0-0034504973,"In previous work, researchers have attempted to construct taxonomies of information visualization techniques by examining the data domains that are compatible with these techniques. This is useful because implementers can quickly identify various techniques that can be applied to their domain of interest. However, these taxonomies do not help the implementers understand how to apply and implement these techniques. In this paper, we will extend and then propose a new way to taxonomize information visualization techniques by using the Data State Model [Chi98]. In fact, as the taxonomic analysis in this paper will show, many of the techniques share similar operating steps that can easily be reused. The paper shows that the Data State Model not only helps researchers understand the space of design, but also helps implementers understand how information visualization techniques can be applied more broadly.","IEEE, Piscataway, NJ, United States",IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization 2000 (INFOVIS 2000),9 October 2000 through 10 October 2000,Chi Ed H.,7102932536;,"Chi, Ed H., Xerox Palo Alto Research Cent, Palo, United States",Proceedings of the IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization,Proc Inf Visual Conf,277.0

Our method is fundamentally different to conventional clustering algorithms, such as C-means, K-means, or linkage methods that are primarily designed to partition a collection of objects into subsets sharing similar attributes. These approaches usually lack an efficient level-of-detail strategy that breaks down the visual complexity of very large datasets for visualization. In contrast, our method combines grouping and visualization in a two stage process constructing a hierarchical setting. In the first stage a cluster tree is computed making use of an edge contraction operator. Exploiting the inherent hierarchical structure of this tree, a second stage visualizes the clusters by computing a hierarchy of implicit surfaces. We believe that H-BLOB is especially suited for the visualization of very large datasets and for visual decision making in information visualization.

Getting portals to behave,2000,2-s2.0-0034497532,"Data visualization environments help users understand and analyze their data by permitting interactive browsing of graphical representations of the data. To further facilitate understanding and analysis, many visualization environments have special features known as portals, which are sub-windows of a data canvas. Portals provide a way to display multiple graphical representations simultaneously, in a nested fashion. This makes portals an extremely powerful and flexible paradigm for data visualization. Unfortunately, with this flexibility comes complexity. There are over a hundred possible ways each portal can be configured to exhibit different behaviors. Many of these behaviors are confusing and certain behaviors can be inappropriate for a particular setting. It is desirable to eliminate confusing and inappropriate behaviors. In this paper, we construct a taxonomy of portal behaviors and give recommendations to help designers of visualization systems decide which behaviors are intuitive and appropriate for a particular setting. We apply these recommendations to an example setting that is fully visually programmable and analyze the resulting reduced set of behaviors. Finally, we consider a real visualization environment and demonstrate some problems associated with behaviors that do not follow our recommendations.","IEEE, Piscataway, NJ, United States",IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization 2000 (INFOVIS 2000),9 October 2000 through 10 October 2000,"Olston Chris, Woodruff Allison",6602571027;55181034600;,"Olston, Chris, Stanford Univ, Stanford, United States; Woodruff, Allison, Stanford Univ, Stanford, United States",Proceedings of the IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization,Proc Inf Visual Conf,7.0

The mining of sequential patterns is designed to find patterns of discrete events that frequently happen in the same arrangement along a timeline. Like association and clustering, the mining of sequential patterns is among the most popular knowledge discovery techniques that apply statistical measures to extract useful information from large datasets. As our computers become more powerful, we are able to mine bigger datasets and obtain hundreds of thousands of sequential patterns in full detail. With this vast amount of data, we argue that neither data mining nor visualization by itself can manage the information and reflect the knowledge effectively. Subsequently, we apply visualization to augment data mining in a study of sequential patterns in large text corpora.

Initial examination of ease of use for 2D and 3D information visualizations of Web content,2000,2-s2.0-0034316981,"We present a discussion and initial empirical investigation of user-interface designs for a set of three Web browsers. The target end-user population we identified were experienced software engineers who maintained large Web sites or portals. The user study demonstrated the strengths and weaknesses of two conventional 2D browsers for this target user, as well as that of XML3D, a novel browser that integrates an interactive 3D hyperbolic graph view with a more traditional 2D list view of the data. A standard collapse/expand tree browser and a Web-based hierarchical categorization similar to Yahoo!, were competitively evaluated against XML3D. No reliable difference between the two 2D browsers was observed. However, the results showed clear differences between XML3D and the 2D user interfaces combined. With XML3D, participants performed search tasks within existing categories reliably faster with no decline in the quality of their responses. It was informally observed that integrating the ability to view the overall structure of the information space with the ability to easily assess local and global relationships was key to successful search performance. XML3D was the only tool of the three that efficiently showed the overall structure within one visualization. The XML3D browser accomplished this by combining a 3D graph layout view as well as an accompanying 2D list view. Users did opt to use the 2D user-interface components of XML3D during new category search tasks, and the XML3D performance advantage was no longer obtained in those conditions. In addition, there were no reliable differences in overall user satisfaction across the three user-interface designs. Since we observed subjects using the XML3D features differently depending on the kind of search task, future studies should explore optimal ways of integrating the use of novel focus+context visualizations and 2D lists for effective information retrieval. The contribution of this paper is that it includes empirical data to demonstrate where novel focus+context views might benefit experienced users over and above more conventional user-interface techniques, in addition to where design improvements are warranted.","Academic Press Ltd, London",,,"Risden K., Czerwinski M.P., Munzner T., Cook D.B.",6506736361;7005748472;6603594088;7403472856;,"Risden, K., Microsoft Corporation, Microsoft Research, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052, United States; Czerwinski, M.P., Microsoft Corporation, Microsoft Research, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052, United States; Munzner, T., Stanford Comp.

Creating reusable visualizations with the relational visualization notation,2000,2-s2.0-0034446289,"Richly expressive information visualizations are difficult to design and rarely found. Few software tools can generate multi-dimensional visualizations at all, let alone incorporate artistic detail. Although, it is a great efficiency to reuse these visualizations with new data, the associated artistic detail is rarely reusable. The Relational Visualization Notation is a new technique and toolkit for specifying highly expressive graphical representations of data without traditional programming. We seek to discover the accessible power of this notation - both its graphical expressiveness and its ease of re-use. Towards this end we have used the system to reconstruct Minard's visualization of Napoleon's Russian campaign of 1812. The resulting image is strikingly similar to the original, and the design is straightforward to construct. Furthermore, the design permitted by the notation can be directly reused to visualize Hitler's WWII defeat before Moscow. This experience leads us to believe that artistically expressive visualizations can be made to be reusable.",IEEE Computer Society,2000 IEEE Visualization Conference,8 October 2000 through 13 October 2000,Humphrey M.C.,7102783809;,"Humphrey, M.C., 11 Wild Plum Court, Stafford, VA 22554, United States",Proceedings of the IEEE Visualization Conference,Proc IEEE Visual Conf,7.0
Snap-together visualization: Can users construct and operate coordinated visualizations?,2000,2-s2.0-0034318787,"Multiple coordinated visualizations enable users to rapidly explore complex information. However, users often need unforeseen combinations of coordinated visualizations. Snap-together visualization (Snap) enables users to rapidly and dynamically construct coordinated-visualization interfaces, customized for their data, without programming. Users load data into desired visualizations, then construct coordinations between them for brushing and linking, overview and detail view, drill down, etc. Snap formalizes a conceptual model of visualization coordination based on the relational data model. Visualization developers can easily Snap-enable their independent visualizations using a simple API. Empirical evaluation reveals benefits, cognitive issues and usability concerns with coordination concepts and Snap. Two user studies explore coordination construction and operation. Data-savvy users successfully, enthusiastically and rapidly constructed powerful coordinated-visualization interfaces of their own. Operating an overview-and-detail coordination reliably improved user performance by 30-80% over detail-only and uncoordinated interfaces for most tasks.","Academic Press Ltd, London",,,"North C., Shneiderman B.",7102686557;7006313615;,"North, C., Human-Computer Interaction Lab., Department of Computer Science, University of Maryland, College Park, MD 20742, United States, Department of Computer Science, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA 24061, United States; Shneiderman, B., Human-Computer Interaction Lab., Department of Computer Science, University of Maryland, College Park, MD 20742, United States",International Journal of Human Computer Studies,Int J Hum Comput Stud,112.0
Hypertext authoring and visualization,2000,2-s2.0-0034317982,"Visualizing information structure plays an increasing role in hypertext systems. Empirical evidence shows that such visualizations support the users or readers of hypertext systems. The following study investigates whether such information visualizations in the form of two-dimensional graphical overview maps also support the writers of hypertext documents. It also seems plausible to assume that the process of writing text changes when graphical overview maps integrated into hypertext systems are used. We also analyzed the relationship between the authoring process and the character of the finished documents. In general, it can be said that visualizing the information structure inherent in a document plays an important role in hypertext authoring. It was the only innovative feature of the hypertext authoring system we developed which was used intensively by almost all the authors. In contrast to that, the finished documents were rather traditional. Authors did not exploit the novel features of hypertext/hypermedia systems like, e.g. introducing pictures, movies or sounds. On the basis of the analysis of the hypertext authoring process guidelines can be formulated to support writers of hypertext documents.","Academic Press Ltd, London",,,"Pohl M., Purgathofer P.",7202059582;6507307461;,"Pohl, M., Dept. for Des. and Technol.

Developing a geographic visualization tool to support Earth Science learning,2000,2-s2.0-0034287333,"This paper reports on the development and assessment of the Earth Systems Visualizer (ESV), a geovisualization tool designed to facilitate learning about global weather. Our goals in designing ESV were to evaluate two exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) techniques, temporal brushing and temporal focusing, and to determine whether interactive geovisualization tools influence problem solving strategies, approaches to learning, and students' ability to generate hypotheses about earth-science processes. Focus group sessions were conducted with both expert and novice users to assess an initial design for the ESV interface prior to conducting a task-based assessment to ESV use. Changes were implemented in response to the focus group results, including the redesign of a temporal legend and improved speed and direction controls. Our task-based assessment considered student reactions to components of ESV, especially whether they could use it to answer questions about global-scale weather processes, and whether the system (particularly its focusing and brushing tools) had an impact on the hypotheses generated about relationships among weather variables. The assessment revealed that focusing and brushing had little impact on students' ability to answer questions about weather processes, and that performance suffered for students who were confused by the focusing and brushing tools. In facts, students who understood the tools performed the best, but students without the tools performed better than those who had the tools but were unsure how to use them. We also concluded that the level of the visualization system must be well matched to the knowledge users have about the application domain: students who already possessed an advanced understanding of meteorology or climatology benefited less and were more critical of the system than students with an intermediate or a novice level of understanding.",,,,"Harrower M., Mac Eachren A., Griffin A.L.",6603561554;7004102300;57201497598;,"Harrower, M., GeoVISTA Center, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA 16802-5011, United States; Mac Eachren, A., GeoVISTA Center, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA 16802-5011, United States; Griffin, A.L., GeoVISTA Center, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA 16802-5011, United States",Cartography and Geographic Information Science,Cartogr.

Realtime visualization of the learning processes in the LAPART neural architecture as it controls a simulated autonomous vehicle,2000,2-s2.0-0033713946,"Using a neural network as an abstract black box makes it hard to grasp its inner workings and so we may easily miss significant information about the network learning process. Interdependencies between the network and its associated complex model simulation may be even harder to interpret. Visualizing a dynamic functioning neural network along with its related model simulation may lead to a deeper comprehension of both. We propose using a virtual environment as a tool to investigate the complex space of a neural network. As an example, we train a simulated remote autonomous vehicle to locomote a preplanned path through a set of obstacles using a LAPART neural network. Within the virtual environment, we can easily and naturally position ourselves to best observe the activity in which we are most interested and discover the evolving space of an operating neural network.","IEEE, Piscataway, NJ, United States",International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN'2000),24 July 2000 through 27 July 2000,"Edlund Kim M., Caudell Thomas P.",6701551036;7003941236;,"Edlund, Kim M., Univ of New Mexico, Albuquerque, United States; Caudell, Thomas P., Univ of New Mexico, Albuquerque, United States",Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks,Proc Int Jt Conf Neural Networks,3.0
Assessing self-organization using order metrics,2000,2-s2.0-0033698409,"Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) are proving to be useful as data analysis and visualization tools because they can visually render the data analysis results in 2D or 3D, and do not need category information for each input pattern. But this unsupervised nature of the training process makes it difficult to have separate training and test sets to determine the quality of the training process, which is done quite naturally for supervised Neural Network learning algorithms. In applications like data analysis, where there is little clue as to the way the SOM is supposed to look like after training, it is important to be able to assess the quality of the self-organization process independent of the application, and without need for category information. The Average Unit Disorder has been used to assess the quality of the ordering of a self-organized map. It is shown here that this same order metric can be used to assess the quality of the self-organization process itself. Based on this order metric, it can be determined whether the SOM has adequately learned, whether the parameters used to train the SOM have been correctly specified, and whether the SOM variant used is well-suited to the specific problem at hand.","IEEE, Piscataway, NJ, United States",International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN'2000),24 July 2000 through 27 July 2000,Azcarraga Arnulfo P.,6603344705;,"Azcarraga, Arnulfo P., Natl Univ of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore",Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks,Proc Int Jt Conf Neural Networks,4.0

Hierarchical probabilistic principal component subspaces for data visualization,1999,2-s2.0-0033316294,"Visual exploration has proven to be a powerful tool for multivariate data mining. Most visualization algorithms aim to find a projection from the data space down to a visually perceivable rendering space. To reveal all of the interesting aspects of complex data sets living in a high-dimensional space, a hierarchical visualization algorithm is introduced which allows the complete data set to be visualized at the top level, with clusters and subclusters of data points visualized at deeper levels. The methods involve multiple use of standard finite normal mixture models and probabilistic principal component projections, whose parameters are estimated using the expectation-maximization and principal component neural networks under the information theoretic criteria.

Collapsing flow topology using area metrics,1999,2-s2.0-0033314712,"Visualization of topological information of a vector field can provide useful information on the structure of the field. However, in turbulent flows standard critical point visualization will result in a cluttered image which is difficult to interpret. This paper presents a technique for collapsing topologies. The governing idea is to classify the importance of the critical points in the topology. By only displaying the more important critical points, a simplified depiction of the topology can be provided. Flow consistency is maintained when collapsing the topology, resulting in a visualization which is consistent with the original topology. We apply the collapsing topology technique to a turbulent flow field.","IEEE, Los Alamitos, CA, United States",Proceedings of the IEEE Visualization '99,24 October 1999 through 29 October 1999,"de Leeuw Wim, van Liere Robert",8592312500;57195257466;,"de Leeuw, Wim, CWI, Amsterdam, Netherlands; van Liere, Robert, CWI, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Proceedings of the IEEE Visualization Conference,Proc IEEE Visual Conf,71.0

Often the explicit modelling of the processes underlying the measurements is very hard and so inferences from the measurement data must be made by learning methods. A widely used class of learning algorithms are the neural learning paradigms. In this paper, emphasis is on unsupervised neural learning. Especially the techniques of Self-Organizing Maps and Independent Component Analysis are reviewed and shown to be useful in this context.

Navigating hierarchies with structure-based brushes,1999,2-s2.0-0033280980,"Interactive selection is a critical component in exploratory visualization, allowing users to isolate subsets of the displayed information for highlighting, deleting, analysis, or focussed investigation. Brushing, a popular method for implementing the selection process, has traditionally been performed in either screen space or data space. In this paper, we introduce the concept of a structure-based brush, which can be used to perform selection in hierarchically structured data sets. Our structure-based brush allows users to navigate hierarchies by specifying focal extents and level-of-detail on a visual representation of the structure. Proximity-based coloring, which maps similar colors to data that are closely related within the structure, helps convey both structural relationships and anomalies. We describe the design and implementation of our structure-based brushing tool. We also validate its usefulness using two distinct hierarchical visualization techniques, namely hierarchical parallel coordinates and tree-maps.","IEEE, Piscataway, NJ, United States",Proceedings of the 1999 IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization (InfoVIS'99),24 October 1999 through 29 October 1999,"Fua Ying-Huey, Ward Matthew O., Rundensteiner Elke A.",6507045578;7403169452;7005195084;,"Fua, Ying-Huey, Worcester Polytechnic Inst, Worcester, United States; Ward, Matthew O., Worcester Polytechnic Inst, Worcester, United States; Rundensteiner, Elke A., Worcester Polytechnic Inst, Worcester, United States",Proceedings of the IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization,Proc Inf Visual Conf,36.0
LabelSOM: On the labeling of self-organizing maps,1999,2-s2.0-0033342817,"Self-organizing maps are a prominent unsupervised neural network model providing cluster analysis of high-dimensional input data. However, in spite of enhanced visualization techniques for self-organizing maps, interpreting a trained map proves to be difficult because the features responsible for a specific cluster assignment are not evident from the resulting map representation. In this paper we present our LabelSOM approach for automatically labeling a trained self-organizing map with the features of the input data that are the most relevant ones for the assignment of a set of input data to a particular cluster. The resulting labeled map allows the user to understand the structure and the information available in the map and the reason for a specific map organization, especially when only little prior information on the data set and its characteristics is available. We demonstrate the applicability of the LabelSOM method in the field of data mining providing an example from real world text mining.","IEEE, United States",International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN'99),10 July 1999 through 16 July 1999,Rauber Andreas,57074846700;,"Rauber, Andreas, Technische Universitat Wien, Wien, Austria",Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks,Proc Int Jt Conf Neural Networks,46.0
Multi-layered perceptron based dimensionality reduction,1999,2-s2.0-0033307279,"Dimensionality reduction is the process of mapping high dimensional patterns to a lower dimensional manifold and is typically used for visualization or as a preprocessing step in classification applications. From a classification viewpoint, the rate of increase of Bayes error serves as an ideal choice to measure the loss of information relevant to classification. Motivated by that, we present a multi-layered perceptron which produces as output the lower dimensional representation. The multi-layered perceptron is trained so as to minimize the classification error in the subspace. It thus differs from auto-associative like multi-layered perceptrons which have been proposed and used for dimensionality reduction. We examine the performance of the proposed method of dimensionality reduction and the effect that varying the parameters have on the algorithm.","IEEE, United States",International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN'99),10 July 1999 through 16 July 1999,"Lotlikar Rohit, Kothari Ravi",55998521400;7102424796;,"Lotlikar, Rohit, Univ of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, United States; Kothari, Ravi, Univ of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, United States",Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks,Proc Int Jt Conf Neural Networks,1.0

Visualizing association rules for text mining,1999,2-s2.0-0033280011,"An association rule in data mining is an implication of the form X → Y where X is a set of antecedent items and Y is the consequent item. For years researchers have developed many tools to visualize association rules.

Thus, it is extremely difficult to visualize and understand the association information of a large data set even when all the rules are available.

Operator interaction framework for visualization systems,1998,2-s2.0-0032304798,"Information visualization encounters a wide variety of different data domains. The visualization community has developed representation methods and interactive techniques. As a community, we have realized that the requirements in each domain are often dramatically different. In order to easily apply existing methods, researchers have developed a semiology of graphic representations. We have extended this research into a framework that includes operators and interactions in visualization systems, such as a visualization spreadsheet. We discuss properties of this framework and use it to characterize operations spanning a variety of different visualization techniques. The framework developed in this paper enables a new way of exploring and evaluating the design space of visualization operators, and helps end-users in their analysis tasks.","IEEE, Piscataway, NJ, United States",Proceedings of the 1998 IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization,19 October 1998 through 20 October 1998,"Chi Ed Huai-hsin, Riedl John T.",7102932536;7005582593;,"Chi, Ed Huai-hsin, Univ of Minnesota, Minnesota, United States; Riedl, John T., Univ of Minnesota, Minnesota, United States",Proceedings of the IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization,Proc Inf Visual Conf,111.0
Shape of Shakespeare: visualizing text using implicit surfaces,1998,2-s2.0-0032295772,"Information visualization focuses on the use of visual means for exploring non-visual information. While free-form text is a rich, common source of information, visualization of text is a challenging problem since text is inherently non-spatial. This paper explores the use of implicit surface models for visualizing text. We describe several techniques for text visualization that aid in understanding document content and document relationships. A simple method is defined for mapping document content to shape. By comparing the shapes of multiple documents, global content similarities and differences may be noted. In addition, we describe a visual clustering method in which documents are arranged in 3D based upon similarity scoring. Documents deemed closely related blend together as a single connected shape. Hence, a document corpus becomes a collection of shapes that reflect inter-document relationships. These techniques provide methods to visualize individual documents as well as corpus meta-data. We then combine the two techniques to produce transparent clusters enclosing individual document shapes. This provides a way to visualize both local and global contextual information. Finally, we elaborate on several potential applications of these methods.",,Proceedings of the 1998 IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization,19 October 1998 through 20 October 1998,"Rohrer Randall M., Ebert David S., Sibert John L.",7006202440;35361180100;57204258441;,"Rohrer, Randall M., George Washington Univ, United States; Ebert, David S., George Washington Univ, United States; Sibert, John L., George Washington Univ, United States",Proceedings of the IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization,Proc Inf Visual Conf,37.0
Visualization of scalar topology for structural enhancement,1998,2-s2.0-0032256646,"Scalar fields arise in every scientific application. Existing scalar visualization techniques require that the user infer the global scalar structure from what is frequently an insufficient display of information. We present a visualization technique which numerically detects the structure at all scales, removing from the user the responsibility of extracting information implicit in the data, and presenting the structure explicitly for analysis. We further demonstrate how scalar topology detection proves useful for correct visualization and image processing applications such as image co-registration, isocontouring, and mesh compression.","IEEE Comp Soc, Los Alamitos, CA, United States",Proceedings of the 1998 IEEE Visualization Conference,18 October 1998 through 23 October 1998,"Bajaj C.L., Pascucci V., Schikore D.R.",7004410340;7004091719;6602891427;,"Bajaj, C.L., Univ of Texas, Austin, United States; Pascucci, V., Univ of Texas, Austin, United States; Schikore, D.R., Univ of Texas, Austin, United States",Proceedings of the IEEE Visualization Conference,Proc IEEE Visual Conf,51.0
TOPIC ISLANDS TM - a wavelet-based text visualization system,1998,2-s2.0-0032272403,"We present a novel approach to visualize and explore unstructured text. The underlying technology, called TOPIC-O-GRAPHY TM, applies wavelet transforms to a custom digital signal constructed from words within a document. The resultant multiresolution wavelet energy is used to analyze the characteristics of the narrative flow in the frequency domain, such as theme changes, which is then related to the overall thematic content of the text document using statistical methods. The thematic characteristics of a document can be analyzed at varying degrees of detail, ranging from section-sized text partitions to partitions consisting of a few words.

Reconfigurable disc trees for visualizing large hierarchical information space,1998,2-s2.0-0032288355,"We present a new visualization technique, called RDT (Reconfigurable Disc Tree) which can alleviate the disadvantages of cone trees significantly for large hierarchies while maintaining its context of using 3D depth. In RDT, each node is associated with a disc around which its children are placed. Using discs instead of cones as the basic shape in RDT has several advantages: significant reduction of occluded region, sharp increase in number of displayed nodes, and easy projection onto plane without visual overlapping. We show that RDT can greatly enhance user perception by transforming its shapes dynamically in several ways: (1) disc tree which can significantly reduce the occluded region by the foreground objects, (2) compact disc tree which can increase the number of nodes displayed on the screen, and (3) plane disc tree which can be mapped onto the plane without visual overlapping. We describe an implementation of our visualization system called VISIT (Visual Information System for reconfigurable dIsc Tree). It provides 2D and 3D layouts for RDT and various user interface features such as tree reconfiguration, tree transformation, tree shading, viewing transformation, animation, selection and browsing which can enhance the user perception and navigation capabilities. We also evaluate our system using the following three metrics: percentage of occlusion, density of displayed nodes on a screen, number of identifiable nodes.","IEEE, Piscataway, NJ, United States",Proceedings of the 1998 IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization,19 October 1998 through 20 October 1998,"Jeong Chang-Sung, Pang Alex",27169509500;7007044166;,"Jeong, Chang-Sung, Korea Univ, Seoul, South Korea; Pang, Alex, Korea Univ, Seoul, South Korea",Proceedings of the IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization,Proc Inf Visual Conf,43.0
Multi-faceted insight through interoperable visual information analysis paradigms,1998,2-s2.0-0032292409,"To gain insight and understanding of complex information collections, users must be able to visualize and explore many facets of the information. This paper presents several novel visual methods from an information analyst's perspective. We present a sample scenario, using the various methods to gain a variety of insights from a large information collection. We conclude that no single paradigm or visual method is sufficient for many analytical tasks. Often a suite of integrated methods offers a better analytic environment in today's emerging culture of information overload and rapidly changing issues. We also conclude that the interactions among these visual paradigms are equally as important as, if not more important than, the paradigms themselves.","IEEE, Piscataway, NJ, United States",Proceedings of the 1998 IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization,19 October 1998 through 20 October 1998,"Hetzler Beth, Whitney Paul, Martucci Lou, Thomas Jim",6701395434;24384857500;6603427841;16195838100;,"Hetzler, Beth, Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Richland, United States; Whitney, Paul, Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Richland, United States; Martucci, Lou, Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Richland, United States; Thomas, Jim, Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Richland, United States",Proceedings of the IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization,Proc Inf Visual Conf,40.0
Interactive out-of-core isosurface extraction,1998,2-s2.0-0032278354,"In this paper, we present a novel out-of-core technique for the interactive computation of isosurfaces from volume data. Our algorithm minimizes the main memory and disk space requirements on the visualization workstation, while speeding up isosurface extraction queries. Our overall approach is a two-level indexing scheme. First, by our meta-cell technique, we partition the original dataset into clusters of cells, called meta-cells. Secondly, we produce meta-intervals associated with the meta-cells, and build an indexing data structure on the meta-intervals. We separate the cell information, kept only in meta-cells in disk, from the indexing structure, which is also in disk and only contains pointers to meta-cells. Our meta-cell technique is an I/O-efficient approach for computing a k-d-tree-like partition of the dataset. Our indexing data structure, the binary-blocked I/O interval tree, is a new I/O-optimal data structure to perform stabbing queries that report from a set of meta-intervals (or intervals) those containing a query value q. Our tree is simpler to implement, and is also more space-efficient in practice than the existing structures. To perform an isosurface query, we first query the indexing structure, and then use the reported meta-cell pointers to read from disk the active meta-cells intersected by the isosurface. The isosurface itself can then be generated from active meta-cells. Rather than being a single-cost indexing approach, our technique exhibits a smooth trade-off between query time and disk space.","IEEE Comp Soc, Los Alamitos, CA, United States",Proceedings of the 1998 IEEE Visualization Conference,18 October 1998 through 23 October 1998,"Chiang Yi-Jen, Silva Claudio T., Schroeder William J.",7201593410;7201387294;7201900328;,"Chiang, Yi-Jen, Polytechnic Univ; Silva, Claudio T., Polytechnic Univ; Schroeder, William J., Polytechnic Univ",Proceedings of the IEEE Visualization Conference,Proc IEEE Visual Conf,81.0
Interactive view for hierarchical clustering,1998,2-s2.0-0032290585,"This paper describes a visualization of a general hierarchical clustering algorithm that allows the user to manipulate the number of classes produced by the clustering method without requiring a radical re-drawing of the clustering tree. The visual method used, a space-filling recursive division of a rectangular area, keeps the items under consideration at the same screen position even while the number of classes is under interactive control. As well as presenting a compact representation of the clustering with different cluster numbers, this method is particularly useful in a linked views environment where additional information can be added to a display to encode other information, without this added level of detail being perturbed when changes are made to the number of clusters.","IEEE, Piscataway, NJ, United States",Proceedings of the 1998 IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization,19 October 1998 through 20 October 1998,Wills Graham J.,7004887635;,"Wills, Graham J., Bell Lab, Naperville, United States",Proceedings of the IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization,Proc Inf Visual Conf,14.0

Information visualization on the Web,1998,2-s2.0-0031638684,"A thin client, by definition, have minimal software requirements necessary to function as a user interface front-end for a Web enabled application and raises the issue of client vs. server data visualization rendering. Real-time visual data manipulation doesn't translate well into a `thin' client. While the VRML file format allows distribution of visualization scenes to the Web, the user has no access to the actual underlying data source. The `mapping' of numerical data into geometry format (VRML) takes place at the server side. Local data manipulation, information drill-down technique, context sensitive menus, object picking and other interactive user interface functions that traditionally have been available on the client are now controlled by the visualization server. In the `thin' client model, nearly all functionality is delivered from the server side of the visualization engine while the client perform very simple display and querying functions. Web components and Plug-ins are now being used to overcome some of these limitations. Java allows the creation of `applets' and `JavaBeans' and we have Windows/COM components. These components together with data reduction methods can significantly increase the data interaction between the client application and user, and allow tasks to be executed on the client. Highly interactive user interface tasks are delivered that provide point-and-click navigation through multidimensional data structures. Visual data interfaces such as information drilling, moving a cutting plane through a volume data set etc can be supported. The implication of using a static VRML environment with reduced geometry is compared to sending compressed data to the client and perform interactive client data visualization on a desktop.","IEEE, Piscataway, NJ, United States","Proceedings of the 1998 International Conference on Information Visualization, IV",29 July 1998 through 31 July 1998,Jern Mikael,6602448282;,"Jern, Mikael, Advanced Visual Systems, Birkeroed, Denmark",Proceedings of the IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization,Proc Inf Visual Conf,3.0
On encouraging multiple views for visualization,1998,2-s2.0-0031625813,"Visualization enables `seeing the unseen', and provides new insight into the underlying data. However, users far too easily believe or rely on a single representation of the data; this view may be a favourite method, the simplest to perform, or a method that has always been used! But, a single representation may generate a misinterpretation of the information or provide a situation where the user is missing the `richness' of the data content! By displaying the data in multiple ways a user may understand the information through different perspectives, overcome possible misinterpretations and perform interactive investigative visualization through correlating the information between views. Thus, the use of multiple views of the same information should be encouraged. We believe the visualization system itself should actively encourage the generation of multiple views by providing appropriate tools to aid in this operation. We present and categorize issues for encouraging multiple views and provide a framework for the generation, management and manipulation of such views.","IEEE, Piscataway, NJ, United States","Proceedings of the 1998 International Conference on Information Visualization, IV",29 July 1998 through 31 July 1998,Roberts Jonathan C.,7410320344;,"Roberts, Jonathan C., Univ of Kent at Canterbury, Kent, United Kingdom",Proceedings of the IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization,Proc Inf Visual Conf,57.0
Visualization of GIS data in VR related to cognitive mapping of environment,1998,2-s2.0-0031634025,"In the paper, the main concepts about a design tool and its testing supported by an visualization of GIS data in VR system will be described. The design tool should improve architectural design with respect to analysis and improving existing and planned urban environments regarding several quality criteria, especially those associated with visual aspects. Preconditions for defining the design tool's purpose are the determination of the `well-situated' urban elements, their impact on cognitive mapping, and the exploitation of this knowledge on cognitive mapping for the improvement of urban environments. Cognitive mapping is a kind of representation of schematic knowledge that a person has about familiar environments. A cognitive map is stored information or knowledge about the purpose and function of the environment. This leads to the conclusion that an urban environment design which takes of the process of cognitive mapping into consideration, will be experienced by most of the people in the same way. Investigations of this process result in a theoretical model of elements of urban environments, their relationships and their dependencies. The theoretical platform of the tool is based on design theory, cognitive science and computer science. Design theory and cognitive science are used to develop the theoretical model. This theoretical model together with computer science are the basis for tool development. The tool uses a schematic representation of urban environment, based partly on Lynch's theory of `urban form' (1960). Lynch's theory is crucial for the tool because it explains almost all elements of urban environments. Systematic investigation of urban environments and their characteristics are important for theoretical and computational modeling as well as for the later testing of the tool. The main computational support for the tool testing is provided by an visualization of GIS data in virtual environment. The information represented in the GIS data visualization is used to analyze urban environments as well as to improve and control their visual quality.","IEEE, Piscataway, NJ, United States","Proceedings of the 1998 International Conference on Information Visualization, IV",29 July 1998 through 31 July 1998,Sidjanin Predrag,6506191479;,"Sidjanin, Predrag, TU Delft, Delft, Netherlands",Proceedings of the IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization,Proc Inf Visual Conf,1.0
Visual Evaluation of GIS Algorithms Using a Reference Grid,1998,2-s2.0-0031694741,"Geographic Information Systems (GIS) algorithms are used to simplify, edge match, and overlay large data sets. Some of these GIS processes can cause considerable positional changes to spatial data which are sometimes difficult to assess. This study presents a visualization technique for the evaluation of GIS algorithms and their positional effects on spatial data. The technique is applicable to vector representations and can be used with any GIS operation that changes vector geometry. The technique employs a uniform reference grid to exploit the visual skills of human operators in the evaluation of positional changes in spatial databases after applying GIS transformations. Changes in grid cell length, area, and shape, along with a set of displacement vectors, can be analyzed to evaluate positional changes in spatial data and to compare the behaviors of different algorithms. The technique can assist GIS users in the documentation of positional changes and in the comparison and selection of algorithms for various mapping tasks.

The goal of the data mining was to see whether some other possibly non-linear combination of the fundamental position dependent DNA nucleotide frequency values could be a better predictor than the AMI[6]. We tried many different classification techniques including rule-based classifiers and neural networks. We also used visualization of both the original data and the results of the data mining to help verify patterns and to understand the distinction between the different types of data and classifications.

Previously, we presented a system for visualizing similarities between a single DNA sequence and a large database of other DNA sequences. Similarity algorithms generate similarity information in textual reports that can be hundreds or thousands of pages long. Our original system visualized the most important variables from these reports. However, the biologists we work with found this system so useful they requested visual representations of other variables. We present an enhanced system for interactive exploration of this multivariate data. We identify a larger set of useful variables in the information space. The new system involves more variables, so it focuses on exploring subsets of the data. We present an interactive system allowing mapping of different variables to different axes, incorporating animation using a time-axis, and providing tools for viewing subsets of the data. Detail-on-demand is preserved by hyperlinks to the analysis reports. We present three case studies illustrating the use of these techniques. The combined technique of applying a time axis with a 3D scatter plot and query filters to visualization of biological sequence similarity data is both powerful and novel.","IEEE, Los Alamitos, CA, United States",Proceedings of the 1996 IEEE Visualization Conference,27 October 1996 through 1 November 1996,"Chi Ed Huai-hsin, Riedl John, Shoop Elizabeth, Carlis John V., Retzel Ernest, Barry Phillip",7102932536;7005582593;6602731721;6701456732;6603669709;7101825059;,"Chi, Ed Huai-hsin, Univ of Minnesota, Minneapolis, United States; Riedl, John, Univ of Minnesota, Minneapolis, United States; Shoop, Elizabeth, Univ of Minnesota, Minneapolis, United States; Carlis, John V., Univ of Minnesota, Minneapolis, United States; Retzel, Ernest, Univ of Minnesota, Minneapolis, United States; Barry, Phillip, Univ of Minnesota, Minneapolis, United States",Proceedings of the IEEE Visualization Conference,Proc IEEE Visual Conf,13.0
Directional flow visualization of vector fields,1996,2-s2.0-0030378672,"This paper presents interactive flow visualization methods that highlight directional information in the flow field. An added benefit of the proposed methods is that they reduce the amount of data being displayed and hence reduce clutter. The main idea behind these methods is the use of light sources to select and highlight regions in the flow field with similar directions. Varying the lighting conditions, by moving the light source and/or adding more lights, emphasizes different vector directions, set of directions, and vectors within a specified angle of a particular direction. The methods are straight forward, computationally inexpensive, and can be combined with other techniques that use glyph representation and other flow geometry such as streamlines for feature visualization. We apply these methods to an analytic data set to help explain how they work, and then to a simulation data set to highlight flow reversals.","IEEE, Los Alamitos, CA, United States",Proceedings of the 1996 IEEE Visualization Conference,27 October 1996 through 1 November 1996,"Boring Ed, Pang Alex",6602935841;7007044166;,"Boring, Ed, Univ of California, Santa Cruz, United States; Pang, Alex, Univ of California, Santa Cruz, United States",Proceedings of the IEEE Visualization Conference,Proc IEEE Visual Conf,12.0
Two-handed interactive stereoscopic visualization,1996,2-s2.0-0030382136,"This paper describes a minimally immersive interactive system for visualization of multivariate volumetric data. The system, SFA, uses glyph-based volume rendering which does not suffer the initial costs of isosurface rendering or voxel-based volume rendering, while offering the capability of viewing the entire volume. Glyph rendering also allows the simultaneous display of multiple data values per volume location. Two-handed interaction using three-space magnetic trackers and stereoscopic viewing are combined to produce a minimally immersive volumetric visualization system that enhances the user's three-dimensional perception of the data. We describe the usefulness of this system for visualizing volumetric scalar and vector data. SFA allows the three-dimensional volumetric visualization, manipulation, navigation, and analysis of multivariate, time-varying volumetric data, increasing the quantity and clarity of the information conveyed from the visualization system.","IEEE, Los Alamitos, CA, United States",Proceedings of the 1996 IEEE Visualization Conference,27 October 1996 through 1 November 1996,"Ebert David S., Shaw Christopher D., Zwa Amen, Starr Cindy",35361180100;7402629891;6507876398;7006726108;,"Ebert, David S., Univ of Maryland Baltimore County, Baltimore, United States; Shaw, Christopher D., Univ of Maryland Baltimore County, Baltimore, United States; Zwa, Amen, Univ of Maryland Baltimore County, Baltimore, United States; Starr, Cindy, Univ of Maryland Baltimore County, Baltimore, United States",Proceedings of the IEEE Visualization Conference,Proc IEEE Visual Conf,16.0
Cheops: A compact explorer for complex hierarchies,1996,2-s2.0-0030382137,"As the amount of electronic information explodes, hierarchies to handle this information become huge and complex. Visualizing and interacting with these hierarchies become daunting tasks. The problem is exacerbated if the visualization is to be done on mass-market personal computers, with limited processing power and visual resolution. Many of the current visualization techniques work effectively for hierarchies of 1000 nodes. But as the number of nodes increases toward 5000 nodes, these techniques tend to break down. Hierarchies above 5000 nodes usually require special modifications such as clustering, which can affect visual stability. This paper introduces Cheops, a novel approach to the representation, browsing and exploration of huge, complex information hierarchies such as the Dewey Decimal system, which can contain between 1 million and 1 billion nodes. The Cheops approach maintains context within a huge hierarchy, while simultaneously providing easy access to details. This paper will also present some preliminary results from usability tests performed on an 8 wide by 9 deep classification hierarchy, which if fully populated would contain over 19 million nodes.","IEEE, Los Alamitos, CA, United States",Proceedings of the 1996 IEEE Visualization Conference,27 October 1996 through 1 November 1996,"Beaudoin Luc, Parent Marc-Antoine, Vroomen Louis C.",57197679004;36852331400;36865429100;,"Beaudoin, Luc, Cent de Recherche Informatique de, Montreal, Montreal, Canada; Parent, Marc-Antoine, Cent de Recherche Informatique de, Montreal, Montreal, Canada; Vroomen, Louis C., Cent de Recherche Informatique de, Montreal, Montreal, Canada",Proceedings of the IEEE Visualization Conference,Proc IEEE Visual Conf,31.0

Linear iteration time layout algorithm for visualizing high-dimensional data,1996,2-s2.0-0030406791,"A technique is presented for the layout of high-dimensional data in a low-dimensional space. This technique builds upon the force-based methods that have been used previously to make visualizations of various types of data such as bibliographies and sets of software modules. The canonical force-based model, related to solutions of the N-body problem, has a computational complexity of O(N2) per iteration. In this paper is presented a stochastically-based algorithm of linear complexity per iteration which produces good layouts, has low overhead, and is easy to implement. Its performance and accuracy are discussed, in particular with regard to the data to which it is applied. Experience with application to bibliographic and time series data, which may have a dimensionality in the tens of thousands, is described.","IEEE, Los Alamitos, CA, United States",Proceedings of the 1996 IEEE Visualization Conference,27 October 1996 through 1 November 1996,Chalmers Matthew,7005801989;,"Chalmers, Matthew, Union Bank of Switzerland, Zurich, Switzerland",Proceedings of the IEEE Visualization Conference,Proc IEEE Visual Conf,101.0

Visualizing multidimensional (multivariate) data and relations - perception vs geometry,1995,2-s2.0-0029488392,"Visualization methodologies that are perceptually satisfying, intuitive, and that preserve multidimensional information are considered. The approach used focused on the foundations, particularly the concepts as against the tools. Starting with a review of the field, visualization is studied as a collection of transformations from 'problem domains' to a perceptual domain, usually visual. This general notion is given specific explanations. A variety rather than a single transformation is examined, since various applications may require specialized notions of visualization.

Recursive pattern: a technique for visualizing very large amounts of data,1995,2-s2.0-0029516791,"An important goal of visualization technology is to support the exploration and analysis of very large amounts of data. In this paper, we propose a new visualization technique called 'recursive pattern' which has been developed for visualizing large amounts of multidimensional data. The technique is based on a generic recursive scheme which generalizes a wide range of pixel-oriented arrangements for displaying large data sets. By instantiating the technique with adequate data- and application-dependent parameters, the user may largely influence the structure of the resulting visualizations. Since the technique uses one pixel for presenting each data value, the amount of data which can be displayed is only limited by the resolution of current display technology and by the limitations of human perceptibility. Beside describing the basic idea of the 'recursive pattern' technique, we provide several examples of useful parameter settings for the various recursion levels. We further show that our 'recursive pattern' technique is particularly advantageous for the large class of data sets which have a natural order according to one dimension (e.g. time series data). We demonstrate the usefulness of our technique by using a stock market application.","IEEE, Los Alamitos, CA, United States",Proceedings of the 1995 6th Annual IEEE Conference on Visualization,29 October 1995 through 3 October 1995,"Keim Daniel A., Kriegel Hans-Peter, Ankerst Mihael",34769953100;7005718994;6603248643;,"Keim, Daniel A., Univ of Munich, Munich, Germany; Kriegel, Hans-Peter, Univ of Munich, Munich, Germany; Ankerst, Mihael, Univ of Munich, Munich, Germany",Proceedings of the IEEE Visualization Conference,Proc IEEE Visual Conf,124.0

Fast algorithms for visualizing fluid motion in steady flow on unstructured grids,1995,2-s2.0-0029487213,"The plotting of streamlines is an effective way of visualizing fluid motion in steady flows. Additional information about the flowfield, such as local rotation and expansion, can be shown by drawing in the form of a ribbon or tube. In this paper, we present efficient algorithms for the construction of streamlines, stream-ribbons and streamtubes on unstructured grids. A specialized version of the Runge-Kutta method has been developed to speed up the integration of particle paths. We have also derived close-form solutions for calculating angular rotation rate and radius to construct streamribbons and streamtubes, respectively. According to our analysis and test results, these formulations are two to four times better in performance than previous numerical methods. As a large number of traces are calculated, the improved performance could be significant.","IEEE, Los Alamitos, CA, United States",Proceedings of the 1995 6th Annual IEEE Conference on Visualization,29 October 1995 through 3 October 1995,"Ueng S.K., Sikorski K., Ma Kwan-Liu",7006871353;35194562700;35242602500;,"Ueng, S.K., Univ of Utah, Salt Lake City, United States; Sikorski, K., Univ of Utah, Salt Lake City, United States; Ma, Kwan-Liu, Univ of Utah, Salt Lake City, United States",Proceedings of the IEEE Visualization Conference,Proc IEEE Visual Conf,10.0
Fast normal estimation using surface characteristics,1995,2-s2.0-0029488955,"To visualize the volume data acquired from computation or sampling, it is necessary to estimate normals at the points corresponding to object surfaces. Volume data does not holds the geometric information for the surface comprising points, so it is necessary to calculate normals using local information at each point. The existing normal estimation methods have some problems of estimating incorrect normals at discontinuous, aliased or noisy points. Yagel et al solved some of these problems using their context-sensitive method. However this method requires too much processing time and it loses some information on detailed parts of the object surfaces. This paper proposes the surface-characteristic-sensitive normal estimation method which applies different operators according to characteristics of each surface for the normal calculation. This method has the same advantages of the context-sensitive method, and also some other advantages such as the less processing time and the reduction of the information loss on detailed parts.","IEEE, Los Alamitos, CA, United States",Proceedings of the 1995 6th Annual IEEE Conference on Visualization,29 October 1995 through 3 October 1995,"Shin Byeong Seok, Shin Yeong Gil",7103027750;7402816561;,"Shin, Byeong Seok, Seoul Natl Univ, Seoul, South Korea; Shin, Yeong Gil, Seoul Natl Univ, Seoul, South Korea",Proceedings of the IEEE Visualization Conference,Proc IEEE Visual Conf,4.0
