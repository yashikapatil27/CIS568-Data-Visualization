# Major Assignment 2: Geospatial Visualizations Using Choropleth Maps

## Overview
In this assignment, three **choropleth maps** were created to visualize population data and its changes over time across counties. The visualizations were implemented using **D3.js** and **TopoJSON** data for Massachusetts counties.

The three choropleth maps are as follows:
1. **Map 1**: Population in 1980.
2. **Map 2**: Population change between 2010 and 2000 for each town.
3. **Map 3**: Color-coded map by county, with interaction features.

Key features implemented:
- **Mouse Interaction**: On mouse hover, each county is highlighted, and data for each county is shown in a tooltip.
- **Color Coding**: Counties were color-coded based on population data and, optionally, the Gini-index for 2017.
- **Page Styling**: The visualizations were styled using basic HTML and CSS to create a clean, centered layout.

- **Key Insights**:
  - **Population Distribution**: The map of population in 1980 gives a clear view of demographic distribution across counties.
  - **Population Change**: The second map shows population change over the 2010â€“2000 period, to visualize areas of growth or decline.
  - **County-Level Color Coding**: The third map colors counties based on the data, with optional coloring by **Gini-index** for the year 2017 for bonus points.
  - **Interactivity**: Hover interactions allow for detailed exploration of county-specific data,.
